Don’t worry about making it look perfect; it should have a rustic feel. Sprinkle with olive oil, salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon of the herbs.\n\nBake the tart: Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and bake the tart at 375°F for 35 to 40 minutes. Check the tart halfway through cooking, and if there are big puffs along the edge or bottom, prick them with the tip of a paring knife so they deflate.\nWhen done, the pastry should be golden at the edges and the potatoes are tender when pierced with a skewer.\n\nServe the tart: Slide the tart onto a large cutting board and sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of fresh herbs and a few pinches of salt.

The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.\n\nQuintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spread squash cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet, then drizzle with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Toss to coat. Bake the squash until tender and caramelized, 15-20 minutes, turning once throughout. Set aside.Bake the bacon: Place an ovenproof baking rack on a second baking sheet. Coat with cooking spray, then arrange the bacon slices on the rack in a single layer. Place on the second rack in the oven with the squash. Bake until the bacon is as crisp as you like, about 12-20 minutes depending upon the thickness of your bacon. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and pat dry. Dice and set aside.Hard boil the eggs:In a small pot, bring just enough water to cover the eggs to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and gently lower the eggs in with a slotted spoon. Bring water to a low, rumbling boil, then let cook for 9 minutes. A few minutes before the eggs are finished cooking, prepare an ice bath. Remove the eggs from the boiling water and plunge into the cold water. Let rest a few minutes, then tap the eggs with back of a spoon to crack them (this will make peeling easier). Return to the ice water to cool completely. Peel the eggs, then cut into slices. Set aside.Cook the chicken: Heat agrill panor an outdoor grill over medium heat. Lightly pound the chicken to an even thickness and sprinkle with kosher salt and pepper. Grill for about 4 minutes per side, until cooked through and the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F.Remove to plate, cover, and let stand for 5-10 minutes.

        To prepare the brine, bring 6 cups water, the salt, sugar, peppercorns, garlic, thyme, bay leaves, and onion to a simmer in a medium pot over medium heat. Stir until the sugar and salt have completely dissolved. Remove from the heat and add the ice cubes to cool.                          Place the pork loin in large freezer bag (or large plastic container with a lid). Pour the brine into the freezer bag, submerging the roast completely, seal, and set aside for 2 hours.                          Preheat the grill and set up two zones-one hot for searing and another medium for cooking through.                          Using the tip of a paring knife, pierce the casing of the sausage all over (this will ensure the flavor of the sausage goes into the pork as it cooks). Remove the pork from the brine and pat it dry with paper towels. Using a clean honing steel, poke a hole into the center of the loin lengthwise and work it all the way through so it creates a cavity. Insert the sausage into the cavity so that it sits neatly within the roast. Season the roast with salt, pepper, granulated garlic, paprika, and cumin.                          Wipe down the grates of the grill with oil-blotted towels. Place the roast on the hot part of the grill and sear fat side down, 3 to 4 minutes, and then on each of the three other sides. Transfer the roast to the cooler part of the grill (indirect heat) and cook until the internal temperature hits 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 45 to 55 minutes. Set the roast on a platter and tent with foil. Allow it to rest for 15 minutes before carving into thick slices. Served drizzled with juices from the platter and the Creole mustard.                          Traditional Oven Cooking Method:                          Pan-roast the pork by searing the roast on all four sides in a hot cast-iron pan over high heat, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer the pan to a preheated 350 degrees F oven and roast for 20 to 25 minutes, until cooked through to a temperature of 165 degrees F in the center. Rest the roast in the pan, then slice and serve with the pan juices and mustard.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Special equipment: Grill with lid Large freezer bag Honing steel Instant-read meat thermometer","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404789,"name":"kitchen thermometer","image":"food-thermometer.jpg"},{"id":404706,"name":"grill","image":"grill.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"To prepare the brine, bring 6 cups water, the salt, sugar, peppercorns, garlic, thyme, bay leaves, and onion to a simmer in a medium pot over medium heat.

Heat the canola oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Season the steaks with salt and pepper. Place them in the hot pan. Cook for about 3 minutes per side for medium rare. Remove the steaks from the pan, cover them loosely with foil, and let them rest for 5 minutes before slicing while you make the sauce.                          Turn the temperature on the skillet down to medium. Add the shallots and cook until they soften a bit, about 2 minutes. Pour in the broth and Worcestershire sauce and bring it up to a simmer. While the broth comes to a simmer, add the gravy mix to a small bowl and mix with 2 tablespoons water. Add to the broth, stir, and let simmer until thickened. Stir in the chocolate and cold butter to thicken the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.                          Place the steaks onto a serving platter, pour the sauce over top (or serve on the side), and garnish with parsley. Serve with Sauteed Mushrooms and Onions.                          In a large skillet over medium heat, add the butter. When the butter has melted, add the mushrooms and onions and season with salt and pepper. Cook until they begin to soften and the mushrooms release their juices, about 7 minutes. Take the pan off of the heat and add the whiskey. Place back on the heat, add the thyme, and cook until the moisture has evaporated and the pan is almost dry, about 3 minutes. Add the cream and bring to a simmer. Cook until the cream thickens a bit, 4 to 5 minutes.

Place the knots on a silpat or parchment-lined baking sheet (if using parchment lightly spray with non-stick spray) an inch apart.Bake 18 - 20 minutes or until the pastries are golden brown - some of the cinnamon may leak out - that's normal.Meanwhile in a large mixing bowl whisk the sugar and cinnamon together for the coating. When the knots are cooked, scoop them up hot and place them in the bowl, use a spoon to gently toss them in the cinnamon sugar. Remove to a wire rack or platter to cool. Meanwhile melt the cream cheese in the microwave until it's soft and creamy about 20 - 30 seconds. Whisk in the confectioners' sugar and vanilla then enough milk to make a glaze. You can make it as thick or as thin as you like. If you make it too thin by mistake just mix in a little more sugar.Serve the knots warm or at room temperature with the glaze for dipping or you can drizzle it over them.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small bowl combine the butter, sugar and cinnamon.Beat the egg and water in a small bowl with a fork.
