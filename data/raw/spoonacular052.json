Its worth the extra step!)In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large mixing bowl, beat the butter and grated ginger until very light, about 4 minutes. Add the brown sugar, then beat until combined. Scrape down the bowl, add the molasses, and beat until incorporated.Place the baking soda in a small bowl. Top with 1 1/2 teaspoons of very hot water, then stir to dissolve. Set aside.Add half of the flour mixture to the butter mixture, then beat just until most of the flour disappears. Beat in the baking soda-water mixture, then scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the remaining half of the flour mixture and beat just until the flour disappears. Mix in the chocolate chunks and any chocolate dust, switching to a wooden spoon if needed to ensure the chunks are evenly distributed. Turn the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap (I used two sheets stuck together at the edges to make it larger), then pat dough into a rough circle that is 1 inch thick.

In the bowl of your stand mixer, mix together the flour, water and yeast until a smooth paste forms. Cover the bowl and allow the preferment to ripen at room temperature overnight. The preferment will double in size and become bubbly on top as it sits.The next day measure out 1/4 cup warm water in a glass measuring cup or bowl. Add the yeast and honey. Mix to combine and then allow the mixture to sit, undisturbed for 5 minutes or until the mixture is foamy on top and smells like bread. During the same time add the remaining 1 1/4 cups warm water to a bowl. Add the oats and ground flax. Allow this mixture to sit 5 minutes.After 5 minutes add both the yeast mixture and oats mixture to the bowl with the preferment from the night before. Add the whole wheat flour, bread flour and salt. Using the dough hook, mix the dough on medium speed for 4-6 minutes. If the dough seems extremely sticky, add 1-2 tablespoons flour.  Now add in 3-4 tablespoons of the mixed seeds. mix until combined. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead with your hands on a floured surface for a minute or two.Grease the bowl you mixed the dough in and place the dough back in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm area for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size.Once the dough has doubled in size, preheat to the oven 450 degrees F. Place a 5-quart, or larger, cast iron dutch oven with a tight fitting lid in the center of the rack. You may also use a baking stone, but I have found the the dutch oven with a lid works the best.Punch the dough down with your fist and then scoop it out onto a floured work surface. Knead the dough a few times with your hands and then form the dough into rough oval or circle shape (if needed, you can divided the dough in half and make two loafs). Place the dough on a parchment lined baking sheet and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise 20-30 minutes. After 20-30 minutes, brush the dough with the beaten egg and then sprinkle with the remaining mixed seeds. Using a sharp knife, gently make a small slit down the center of the loaf. Drizzle the the seeds with 1-2 teaspoons honey. When the dough is ready to bake, carefully remove the hot dutch oven from the oven using oven mitts and remove the lid. Very carefully, pick the dough up by the parchment paper and lift into the hot dutch oven. Using oven mitts, place the hot lid back on the pot and return to the oven. Bake for 20 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees F. Using oven mitts, remove the hot lid and continue baking until the bread is a deep, golden brown, about 15-20 minutes more. Remove from the oven. Using a thin handle of a spatula, carefully lift the bread out of the pot and place it on a rack to cool completely, about 2 hours. Don't slice into the bread right out of the oven, the bread continues to cook as it cools.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"The night before baking the bread make the preferment.

Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are great choices for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":452761,"title":"Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio","description":"Pinot Grigio Ramato continues a tradition of the Republic of Venice, since “ramato”, or coppery, was the term referred to Pinot Grigio in contracts. A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":5,"score":0.8175000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fattems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014%2F160114"}]},"instructions":"Watch how to make this recipe.

For the fish: In a bowl, combine the chile powder, garlic salt, lime juice and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.

For the chipotle sauce: In the meantime, combine the mayonnaise, cilantro, honey, chipotles, lime juice and salt in a food processor and blend until creamy and smooth.

The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

Reserve. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Cut the butter into small chunks and place in a large mixing bowl along with 1 1/2 cups sugar. Use an electric mixer to beat together the butter and sugar for a few minutes. Make sure the butter is fully integrated into the sugar and the mixture turns into small, even-sized crumbs. Add the eggs and oil to the bowl. Continue to mix until smooth.Add the Greek yogurt, vanilla and almond extract to the bowl. Use a spatula to stir the mixture till smooth.In a medium bowl, sift together 2  cups flour, baking soda, 1  tsp cinnamon,  tsp salt, nutmeg and cloves.Fold the dry ingredients into the wet to make a thick batter. Dont overmixa few lumps are okay.In the same medium bowl you used to sift the flour, sift together remaining  cup flour, 2 tbsp sugar and  tsp cinnamon.Drain the peeled apples and pat dry. Core the apples and dice them into small  inch chunks.Add the apple chunks to the flour, sugar and cinnamon mixture. Toss the apple chunks with the flour till evenly coated.Fold the apple chunks and walnuts into the cake batter. Grease two loaf pans with nonstick cooking oil spray. Divide the batter evenly between the two loaf pans.Combine streusel ingredients in a food processor and pulse till a crumbly topping forms. If you dont have a processor, chop the walnuts into very small pieces and mix them with the other streusel ingredients till the mixture is moist and crumbly.Sprinkle the tops of the two cakes evenly with streusel, half on each cake.Place the cakes into the oven. Bake for 60-70 minutes, turning once halfway through cooking, till the top is brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. If the top of the cake browns faster than it bakes, cover with foil for the remainder of baking time. Its a very moist cake, so err on the side of cooking it a little longer if youre unsure, using the foil to protect against burning.Let the cakes cool for 20 minutes in their pans, then gently release and place on a wire rack to cool completely. If the cakes will not release easily, you can also let them cool completely in the pan.To make the glaze icing, sift powdered sugar into a small mixing bowl. Use a whisk to mix the ingredients till a thick and creamy icing forms. You want the consistency of thick honey; if you need a little more moisture, add milk a few drops at a time. Just a drop can take it from a thick honey to a runny texture, so add with care. The thicker the frosting is, the more white it will dry... adding too much water will cause it to dry clearish, and it won't have that nice thick white look to it.Line a glass with a plastic bag, wrapping the edge of the bag around the outer rim of the glass. This will help you fill it with frosting. Use a spatula to scoop the frosting into the bag.Place cakes on top of a piece of parchment paper or paper towels to catch drips.Work the frosting into the corner of the bag and snip off a small corner with scissors. Gently squeeze and drizzle the frosting in a zig-zag pattern across the top of the cakes, using half of the icing for each cake.Let the icing dry for at least 30 minutes to set (it may take longer depending on the weather).Serve cake slices with a cup of tea or coffee. Sigh contentedly. Apple cake is good. Life is good.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Put peeled apples into a bowl of cold water mixed with lemon juice.
