Set the eggplant to the side. Let both cool until comfortable to handle.Cut the eggplant into little chunks. Once the tomatoes have cooled, the peel should come easily off the tomatoes ... pull it off, cut out the cores and chop the tomatoes roughly, capturing the juices as you go. Meanwhile, heat a soup pot over medium heat.

servingsFor the Ham Stock:1 large meaty hambone3 quarts of water2 whole celery stalks (ribs) with leaves, rinsed and cut into large chunks2 large carrots, unpeeled, rinsed and cut into large chunks1 large onion, unpeeled and quartered4 sprigs of fresh parsley2 bay leaves1/2 teaspoon of whole peppercornsFor the Dumplings:3 tablespoons of vegetable shortening1-1/2 cups of self-rising flour1/2 cup buttermilk or milk1/4 cup of reserved ham stockSalt, only if needed, to tastePlace ham bone in a large stockpot, along with the remaining stock ingredients. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 2 hours or until mixture is reduced to about 1-1/2 quarts. Strain, reserving the bone and stock; discard vegetables. Once cooled, pick off any meat from the bone, reserving the meat and discarding the bone. Refrigerating the stock overnight is best when possible.When ready to prepare dumplings, set aside 1/4 cup of the stock. Mix together the dumpling ingredients until they form a soft dough. Bring ham stock to a rolling boil. Using a small spoon, scoop out and drop into boiling broth and cover immediately so that the dumplings begin to steam; simmer on low about 10 minutes before checking. Don't overcook or dumplings will be dense and hard. Taste broth and adjust seasonings if needed, adding freshly cracked black pepper. Carefully scoop broth and a few dumplings into individual serving bowls.Cook's Notes: May substitute 2 or 3 meaty ham hocks. If the bone or hocks you use are not very meaty, add in about 1 to 1-1/2 cups of chopped, smoked ham.Source: http://deepsouthdish.comPRINT THISRequires Adobe Reader - download it free!Deep South

Dissolve yeast in warm water and milk; let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. In another bowl, combine eggs, bourbon and melted butter; stir in 2 cups flour, 1/4 cup sugar, salt and yeast mixture. Beat on medium speed 3 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.

Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide and shape into 36 rolls. Flatten rolls into circles; place 1 chocolate piece in center of each. Fold dough over filling; pinch edges well to seal. Melt remaining butter; pour into a shallow bowl. Place remaining sugar in another shallow bowl.

It should smell amazing! Taste and adjust with more salt if it needs it.                          Reserve 1/3 cup of the marinade and set aside; you're going to make a sauce out of this reserved marinade.                          Prick the chicken thighs with a fork. Add the thighs to the rest of the marinade, and toss to coat. Marinate at least 1 hour in the fridge, and at most overnight.                          When you're ready to cook, line a baking sheet with foil, and turn your broiler on. Place each chicken thigh on the baking sheet, making sure each one is coated with the marinade, but isn't swimming in it. Cook the chicken thighs under the broiler until starting to blacken, about 5 minutes. Then turn the oven to 350, and cook until a meat thermometer inserted in the meatiest part of the thigh registers 160 degrees F, another 10 minutes. Remove from the oven.                          While the chicken is cooking, pour the reserved marinade into a small saucepan, along with 1/2 cup water and the honey. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-low heat, whisking all the time. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and pour into a small bowl or gravy boat for serving.                          Serve the chicken thighs on a platter with a fresh squeeze of lime and a drizzle of the sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the marinade, toast the cloves, whole chiles, both types of cardamom seeds, coriander seeds, fennel seeds and fenugreek seeds in a cast-iron skillet until fragrant, 3 minutes or so, shaking the pan.

the bacon to remove its smoky taste: Drop bacon slices into 2 quarts of cold water, bring to a boil, and simmer 6 to 8 minutes. Drain, rinse in cold water, and dry on paper towels.\n\nSauté the bacon, brown the beef: In a large frying pan, sauté the blanched bacon to brown slightly in a little oil; set them aside and add later to simmer with the beef, using the rendered fat in browning.\nBrown the chunks of beef on all sides in the bacon fat and olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and put them into a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or covered casserole pan.\nCut the bacon into 1-inch pieces and add to the pan.\n\nBrown the vegetables: Remove all but a little fat from the frying pan, add the sliced vegetables and brown them, and add to the meat.\n\nDeglaze the pan with wine, add stock, tomatoes, herbs: Deglaze the pan with wine, pouring it into the casserole along with enough stock to almost cover the meat. Stir in the tomatoes and add the herb bouquet.\n\nSimmer 1 to 2 hours: Bring to a simmer, cover, and simmer slowly on the lowest heat possible, either on the stove or in a preheated 325°F oven, until the meat is tender, about 1 to 2 hours.\n\nWhile the stew is cooking, prepare the onions: Blanch the onions in boiling water for 1 minute. Drain and rinse in cold water to stop the cooking. Slice the end tips off of the onions, peel the onions and score the root end with 1/4 inch cuts.\nSauté onions in a single layer in a tablespoon or two of butter until lightly browned. Add chicken stock or water half way up the sides of the onions. Add a teaspoon of sugar, and season with salt and pepper.\nCover and simmer slowly for 25 minutes or until tender. The onions should absorb most of the water. If there is water remaining after cooking, drain the excess. Set aside.\n\nPrepare the mushrooms a few minutes before serving the stew. Sauté quartered mushrooms in a few tablespoons of butter and olive oil until browned and cooked through.\n\nMake the sauce: When the stew meat has cooked sufficiently, remove all solids from the sauce (except the beef) by draining through a colander set over a saucepan.

just a tiny pinch of brown sugar. Let the mixture sit until the yeast bubbles up, 6 to 8 minutes.Add the remaining 1/4 cup of water, milk, butter, brown sugar, and salt and use a dough hook (or by hand) to combine. Slowly add the flour on low speed. Increase speed to medium-high (or knead by hand vigorously) until the dough is smooth and no longer sticky, adding more flour if needed, one tablespoon at a time. This should take about 6-8 minutes with a stand mixer and 12-15 minutes if kneading by hand.Form the dough into a large ball, cover with a towel, and let the dough rest for 15 minutes. Cut the dough into 8 equal pieces. To make a hot dog bun, shape a piece of dough into a 5-inch log of approximately 1.5 inches in diameter with tapered ends. Arrange the dough logs onto a baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat, leaving about 3 inches of space around each log. To make a hamburger bun, shape a piece of dough into a ball, 3 inches in diameter, flatten it slightly with your palm. Arrange each dough ball onto a baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat, leaving about 3 inches around each ball. Cover the dough balls or logs with a towel. Let them rise for 30 minutes.Once the dough has risen, preheat the oven to 400°F. Put the water in a pot and bring it to a gentle boil. Slowly add the baking soda to the water. Gently lift up each piece of dough and slowly plunge into the simmering liquid. Boil one or two pieces of dough at a time, 20 seconds per side. With a large slotted spoon, scoop the dough balls from the boiling liquid, shake off excess water, and gently place them on the same baking sheets fitted with silicone baking mats, leaving about 3 inches of space between them. With a sharp knife or a dough slasher, make a cross on the top of each hamburger bun and 3 to 4 diagonal cuts on each hot dog bun. Each slash should be about 1/4-inch deep. Sprinkle the top of the unbaked pretzel buns with desired topping(s). Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the pretzel buns develop dark caramel color on the outsides. Remove the buns from the oven and let them cool on a cooking rack, loosely covered with a kitchen towel.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In the bowl of a stand mixer or a large mixing bowl, mix 1/2 cup of the warm water with the yeast and just a tiny pinch of brown sugar.","ingredients":[{"id":19334,"name":"brown sugar","image":"dark-brown-sugar.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"yeast-granules.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"mixing-bowl.jpg"},{"id":404665,"name":"stand mixer","image":"stand-mixer.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Let the mixture sit until the yeast bubbles up, 6 to 8 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"yeast-granules.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":6,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add the remaining 1/4 cup of water, milk, butter, brown sugar, and salt and use a dough hook (or by hand) to combine.

strawberries in a bowl, add the sugar and gently stir to combine. Let the berries sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, until they start to soften and release their juices.                          Transfer the mixture to a medium nonreactive saucepan, add the jam and cook over medium-high heat until slightly softened. Coarsely mash the berries using a potato masher or the back of a fork and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens to a jam-like consistency, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate until cold and thickened further, at least 2 hours.                          For the milkshake: Combine the milk and 1/2 cup strawberry base in the blender and blend for 5 seconds. Add the ice cream and blend until smooth, about 10 seconds. Top with more strawberry base, the Sugar Biscuit and a strawberry for garnish, if using.                          Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.                          Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Using a dough cutter, combine until the ingredients are incorporated. Scatter the cold butter pieces over the top of the flour mixture and continue to combine until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the buttermilk and mix just until the dough begins to come together.                          Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured counter. Pat the dough into a 10 by 12-inch rectangle about 3/4-inch thick. Use a 3-inch round cutter to cut out the biscuits. Press together the scraps of dough and repeat the process. Place the biscuits on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper; brush the tops with cream and sprinkle with sugar. Bake the biscuits until lightly golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush the tops with the remaining melted butter. Yield: 8 biscuits.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"For the strawberry base","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Put the strawberries in a bowl, add the sugar and gently stir to combine.","ingredients":[{"id":9316,"name":"strawberries","image":"strawberries.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Let the berries sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, until they start to soften and release their juices.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":30,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Transfer the mixture to a medium nonreactive saucepan, add the jam and cook over medium-high heat until slightly softened.
