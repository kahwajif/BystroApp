Fold the top over again, this time to within about an inch or so of the bottom. Press the edge to seal. Now pull the bottom of the dough up to meet the dough roll you've created and seal the seam. Pinch the ends closed and place the dough, seam-side-down, in the prepared loaf pan. Cover the pan with plastic wrap; refrigerate overnight or up to 24 hours before baking. The dough should be fully risen after about 6 hours, but a longer rest is good for it. Day Two (baking day): Take the pan out of the refrigerator and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the plastic wrap and brush the top of the bread with egg wash. Bake the bread until it is richly browned and the internal temperature reaches 190 degrees F. on an instant-read thermometer, about 50 minutes.

Arrange one layer in the bottom of a large colander and sprinkle evenly with salt.  Repeat with remaining eggplant, salting, until all eggplant is in the colander.  Weigh down the slices with a couple of plates and let drain for 2 hours.  The purpose of this step is to have the eggplant release some of its moisture before cooking.2 While the eggplant is draining, prepare tomato sauce.  Combine tomatoes, garlic and 1/3 cup olive oil in a food processor.  Season with salt and pepper to tasted and set aside.3 When eggplant has drained, press down on it to remove excess water, wipe off the excess salt, and lay the slices out on paper towels to remove all the moisture.  In a wide, shallow bowl, combine flour and breadcrumbs.  Mix well. Pour beaten eggs into another wide shallow bowl.  Place a large, deep skillet over medium heat, and pour in a a half inch of olive oil.  When oil is shimmering, dredge the eggplant slices first in the flour mixture, then in the beaten egg.  Working in batches, slide coated eggplant into hot oil and fry until golden brown on both sides, turning once.  Drain on paper towels.4  Preheat the oven to 350°F.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Rub the pork on all sides with 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper; set aside.                          Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add the pork and brown it on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Place the pork in the pot with the fat side facing up, and then pour in the tomatillo salsa and chicken broth.                          Bring the mixture to a simmer, cover the pot and transfer to the oven. Cook until the meat pulls apart easily and the internal temperature on an instant read thermometer reads 185 degrees F, about 3 hours. Use 2 forks to shred the pork into smaller pieces, then stir in the white beans and cilantro. Salt and pepper the shredded pork to taste.                          Increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside.                          On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pizza dough to about 1/4 inch thick, 15 inches long and 9 inches wide, then cut into 3 long 3-inch-wide strips. Evenly spread 1 cup of the pork and bean mixture along the long edge of a dough strip. Sprinkle about 1/4 cup cheese over the pork mixture, then carefully roll up the dough to enclose the filling. Arrange the dough seam-side down on the prepared baking sheet in a curved and winding pattern to look like intestines. Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling. Reserve the remaining pork mixture for another use.                          In a small bowl, use a whisk to beat the egg and tomato paste together until completely combined. Brush the dough with the egg wash. Bake until crisp and cooked through, about 25 minutes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
