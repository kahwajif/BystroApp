Add remaining sauce ingredients, bring up to a simmer, and remove from heat.When mixture has cooled a bit, taste and adjust salt if necessary. Blend the sauce with an immersion blender until smooth (I just poured the mix into my regular blender and used that… it makes far less of a splattery mess than the immersion blender).Make the filling: Preheat the oven to 375.Start a large pot of water to boil on the stove. Peel potatoes if you like (I leave the skins on for taste and texture) and chop them into 1-inch cubes. Add to potatoes boiling water and boil until tender, about 15 minutes, then drain, mash a bit with a fork, and set aside.Over a medium-low flame, heat olive oil until it shimmers. Add garlic and cook for one minute, stirring constantly.Add chard, carrots, and peas, and sprinkle with a little sea salt. Increase burner level to medium, stirring constantly to mix chard, oil, and garlic. Cover and steam for about five minutes, until greens are wilted.Remove lid and mix in potatoes, mashing a bit more as you go. You want it loose, but with nice potato-y chunks. Add veggie stock, lime juice, cumin, pumpkin seeds, and salt, cooking another four minutes, until the stock is absorbed. Add more stock or lime juice to taste, then remove from heat.Assemble the enchiladas: Pour about ¾ cup of enchilada sauce into a pie plate or deep dinner plate. Create an assembly line in this order: lightly oiled hot cast iron pan for softening tortillas, plate with sauce, filling, and the baking dish where you’ll be putting your finished enchiladas.Ladle a little sauce into the baking dish and spread it around to lightly cover the bottom. Take a corn tortilla, set it into the hot cast iron pan for 20 seconds, then flip it over and repeat. Once the tortilla is soft and pliable, drop it into the pie plate to completely coat it in sauce, then flip and repeat.Place tortilla in baking dish and run a generous amount of potato filling down the center, rolling it up and placing it in the dish. Continue with the rest of the tortillas, leaving about a quarter inch between them so that they will be easier to plate.Pour 1½ cups of sauce over the top of the enchiladas, reserving the rest for later. Cover tightly with foil and bake for 25 minutes, then remove foil and bake for another ten minutes to brown the edges of tortillas.Allow to cool slightly before serving (they’ll be hot!) and top with a little more enchilada sauce and a dollop of vegan cilantro sour cream.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the sauce: In a large, heavy bottom sauce pan, saute onion in olive oil over medium heat until soft – about five minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Add remaining sauce ingredients, bring up to a simmer, and remove from heat.When mixture has cooled a bit, taste and adjust salt if necessary.

Place back on medium heat and continue vigorously stirring (yes, this is a mini arm workout!) until the dough comes together as a ball, and a thin film starts to form on the bottom of the pan.Remove from the heat and make a well in the center of the dough. Add in one egg and vigorously stir until it is completely combined. Repeat with the other three eggs.Using a large cookie scoop (a 3 tablespoon-sized model), scoop the dough onto the prepared baking sheet, about an inch or two apart.Bake for 15 minutes, until they begin to turn golden. Turn the oven down to 350°F and bake for 15 more minutes. Turn the oven off, crack the door, and allow them to rest in the oven for 10 minutes before removing to cool further.For the chocolate ganache:In a medium bowl, combine the chocolate and salt.Either in the microwave, or on the stove, heat the cream to a simmer. Pour the warm cream over the chocolate. Allow it to sit for a minute, then stir until it is smooth and creamy.To assemble:Scoop the marshmallow fluff into a pastry bag fitted with a small or medium tip of any shape. Stab the tip into the side of the cream puff, and fill with fluff (really as much as you want).Dip the topside of the filled puffs into the chocolate ganache and allow any excess to drip off.Sprinkle the chocolate with the graham cracker crumbs before it sets.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the choux pastry:Preheat oven to 425°F.

Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"InstructionsLine a large soup pot with broth, about 1/4 cup.

Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8073684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Ffonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998%2F12434"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                On bottom half of sandwich buns, layer sausage, ham, pizza sauce, cheese, onion, banana peppers, pepperoni and salami.

If you have a baking stone, place that in the center rack to bake on. Butter two 8\" cake pans, line bottoms with parchment paper, butter parchment, then dust with flour and tap out excess.Spread pecans in a sheet pan and bake in oven for 10 minutes or until gently toasted. Remove from oven and set aside to cool.In a mixer, combine cake flour, baking powder, and sea salt and mix on low for 30 seconds. Set aside. Do not clean bowl.In mixer, beat butter on medium speed until light and fluffy - at least 4 minutes *see note 1. Add in sugar and beat on medium speed until light and fluffy.On low speed, beat in egg yolks and whole eggs one at a time until just blended. On low speed, beat in canola oil.On the lowest speed, stir in flour mix until just blended.Mash bananas well, then mix bananas and pecans into batter.Divide batter between the two 8\" pans, place on a sheet pan and put in the oven, or if using a baking stone , slide directly onto the baking stone in the oven.Bake for 45 minutes - 1 hour or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the middle of each of the pans. The kitchen will noticeably smell of the banana cake as it nears completion. Set aside to cool completely before frosting.Butterscotch Sauce DirectionsIn a heavy saucepan, melt the butter over low-medium heat. Just before butter is completely melted, add the brown sugar, stirring to completely moisten the sugar.Gently cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture caramelizes and transforms from its initial graininess to a smooth “molten lava”.  Make sure to get the corners of the pot and watch closely because the texture will change quickly, 3-5 min.Whisk in all of the cream at once, lower the heat a little, and continue whisking until the the liquid is homogenous. Turn heat back up to medium and cook for another 7 minutes, whisking every few minutes.Turn off the heat and let cool for 15 minutes. Add half of vanilla extract, Scotch, and sea salt, then taste for flavor.  Add more of each until the flavor is perfect to your palate. Pour into a sealable container and allow to cool fully. Store covered and refrigerated for up to a month.Cream Cheese Frosting DirectionsIn a mixer, beat the butter until light and fluffy. Add cream cheese and beat until light and fluffy.Stir in confectioners sugar, vanilla extract, and bitters then slowly increase speed and beat until incorporated. Set aside until ready to frost cake.Banana Cake AssemblyIn a large skillet heat additional 3 T of butter over medium heat. Add sliced bananas and cook until slices start to brown, 1-2 minutes. Carefully turn over bananas and cook other side until browned, 1-2 minutes.If butterscotch has thickened too much to pour, gently heat until it becomes pourable. Set aside.Remove banana cakes from pans, peel off parchment, and trim the tops with a serrated knife to give them flat top surface.Put a dab of frosting in the middle of a cake circle or plate (the frosting helps keep the cake from sliding around). Place the first cake layer on a cake circle or plate. Line several strips of wax paper around base of cake to help keep circle or plate clean.Put about 3/4 cup of frosting in the middle of the cake and spread the frosting working from the center out, leaving a slight built up edge on the outer rim. When finished, you should have nice thin layer of frosting over most of the top surface of the cake, with a 1/2\" little wall on the outer rim that will help hold in the butterscotch.Arrange browned banana slices on bottom layer of cake, keeping within the frosting rim. Pour butterscotch over banana slices (you'll only use about half of the butterscotch).Take second cake and frost a thin layer  on the cut top to seal crumb and keep butterscotch from soaking into cake. Carefully turn over cake and set on top of bananas, frosted side down.Spread frosting over entire cake, swirling to completely cover. Remove strips of wax paper at base of cakes. Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 3 days. Bring to room temperature before serving if possible.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Banana Cake Directions","ingredients":[{"id":9040,"name":"banana","image":"bananas.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Preheat oven to 350º F.

Bake until lightly golden, 15 to 20 minutes.

Stir each bowl independently, unless youre an octopus.

Pour into a small bowl with the almonds and stir.                          Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Pour the fruit filling into the prepared crust, dividing it into thirds with the apples in the middle and the figs and cranberries on either side. Top evenly with the streusel mixture. Cover the pie edges with aluminum foil so they dont overcook. Bake until the top is golden brown and the fruit is beginning to bubble around the edges, 40 to 50 minutes. Serve warm with the bourbon whipped cream.                          Whisk the cream in a large bowl until soft peaks form.

Cook, stirring frequently, until mixture begins to thicken and the blueberries break down a bit.  Remove from heat.Heat the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Mix in butter; stir until melted. Let cool until lukewarm.In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 1/4 cup flour, yeast, sugar and salt; whisk together.  Add water, egg and the milk mixture; beat well with an electric mixer. Add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, using a wooden spoon to stir well after each addition. (dough will be too thick and sticky to use the mixers at this point.)  When the dough has just pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. (dough will spring back when lightly pressed.)Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile melt your butter and mix the brown sugar and cinnamon together for the filling.On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough into a 12x9 inch rectangle. (use your 9x13 baking dish as a guide.)  Using a pastry brush- slather the dough with the butter. Spread the blueberry sauce over the dough and then sprinkle dough with cinnamon sugar mixture and press in lightly so it doesn't fall out when you roll it. Carefully roll up dough and pinch seam to seal. (Roll it as tight as you can so the filling doesn't ooze out.) Cut into 12 equal size rolls and gently place in a 9x13 baking dish. Cover and let the rolls rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30-45 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until browned. Let cool for about 10 minutes and then drizzle them with glaze. (directions below) Serve warm.Whip together the softened butter and cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add the milk and then the vanilla and the powdered sugar, 1/2 cup at a time.

make the gravy. Pat the turkey very dry with paper towels. Whisk 2 tablespoons salt, the brown sugar, chile powder, 2 teaspoons paprika, the cumin, coriander and onion powder in a small bowl. Spread about one-quarter of the rub inside the cavity of the turkey and spread the rest all over the skin. Set the turkey on a rack in a large roasting pan and refrigerate, uncovered, overnight.                          The next day, let the turkey let sit at room temperature, 30 minutes. Position an oven rack in the lowest position (remove the other racks); preheat to 350 degrees F.                          Pour or wipe out any juices that have collected in the bottom of the roasting pan. Stuff the turkey cavity with the onion, carrot, celery and thyme sprigs. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine and tuck the wings under the body.                          Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat; whisk in the chopped thyme and the remaining 1 teaspoon paprika. Let cool slightly, then brush all over the turkey. Transfer to the oven and roast 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the Classic Gravy, adding the heavy cream and chipotle and sauce with the stock in step 2.                          After the turkey has roasted 1 hour, baste it with the drippings. Continue roasting, basting every 30 minutes, until the skin is dark golden brown and a thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 165 degrees F, about 2 more hours.                          Transfer the turkey to a cutting board and let rest 30 minutes before carving; reserve the drippings for the gravy. Stir the vinegar into the finished gravy.                          Prepare the stock: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the turkey neck and giblets; cook, turning, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the onion, carrot, celery, thyme and bay leaves; stir to coat. Add the wine and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the broth, reduce the heat to low and simmer about 1 hour. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring cup; reserve the saucepan. You should have 7 cups stock-if you're short, add more broth.                          Melt the remaining 8 tablespoons butter in the reserved saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk until smooth and bubbling, about 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in the 7 cups stock; bring to a simmer and cook, whisking occasionally, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Set aside until the turkey is done.                          Pour the turkey pan drippings into a fat separator and let stand until the fat rises to the top. Discard the fat (or drizzle on your stuffing). Whisk the defatted drippings into the gravy; season with salt and pepper.

Place onto large rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle on oil and roll around to coat. Sprinkle on the garlic powder and salt and toss to coat. You can add a sprinkle of cayenne pepper if you like it spicy. Roast for 20 minutes at 400F, then gently roll the chickpeas around in the baking sheet, then roast for another 10-15 minutes, until lightly golden. They will firm up as they cool.Prepare the dressing: Add the cashews and all other dressing ingredients (except salt) into a high speed blender, and blend on high until the dressing is super smooth. You can add a splash of water if necessary to get it blending. Add salt to taste and adjust other seasonings, if desired. Set aside.Prepare the Parmesan cheese: Add cashews into a mini food processor and process until finely chopped. Now add in the rest of the ingredients and pulse until the mixture is combined. Salt to taste.Prepare the lettuce: De-stem the kale and then finely chop the leaves. Wash and dry in a salad spinner. Place into extra large bowl. Chop up the romaine into bite-sized pieces.

Paula's Perfect Pie Crust:                          In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, salt and sugar. Add the shortening and break it up with your hands as you start to coat it all up with the flour. Add the cold butter cubes and work it into the flour with your hands or a pastry cutter. Work it quickly, so the butter doesn't get too soft, until the mixture is crumbly, like very coarse cornmeal. Add the ice water, a little at a time, until the mixture comes together forming a dough. Bring the dough together into a ball. When it comes together stop working it otherwise the dough will get over-worked and tough. Divide the dough in half and flatten it slightly to form a disk shape. Wrap each disk in plastic and chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours. On a floured surface roll each disk out into a 10 to 11-inch circle to make a 9-inch pie.

Season with 1 teaspoon salt and freshly ground pepper.                          In a shallow bowl, whisk together the flour, cayenne pepper, paprika, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of freshly ground pepper. In a second shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs and buttermilk. In a third shallow bowl whisk together the panko, cornmeal and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.                          Working with one tomato slice at a time, first coat the tomato with the flour mixture, shaking off the excess. Then coat with the egg mixture, followed by the panko mixture. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining tomatoes.                          Heat 2 cups oil in a large skillet over medium heat until a pinch of panko sizzles when dropped in. Carefully place some of the tomatoes into the heated oil in a single layer. Fry until golden, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat the frying process with the remaining tomatoes, changing the oil if the particles left in the oil between batches begin to burn.                          For the BPT: Cook the bacon in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until desired crispness, 8 to 10 minutes. Gently spread one side of each slice of bread with the jalapeno pimiento cheese. Arrange the bacon, then the fried green tomatoes and then the lettuce on 4 slices. Top with the remaining slices, and cut each sandwich in half. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"For the jalapeno pimiento cheese","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Drain 1 jar of the pimientos and place in a blender or food processor.

cools it slightly, it will still be warm enough to activate the yeast). Sprinkle the yeast evenly over the water. Drizzle the honey over the yeast. Let rest for 5-10 minutes until yeast is very foamy.Add the flour, dry milk, and salt to the bowl. Knead with the dough hook on a low speed. Once the dough starts to form, allow the hook to continue to knead for another 5-6 minutes until the dough is elastic and no longer sticky.Cover the bowl and let dough rise until doubled in size. Punch down the dough and move it to a floured workspace like the kitchen table. Roll out the dough to about 1/4 inch thickness.Cut out the doughnuts, and be sure to cut a small hole in the middle (this prevents the center of the doughnut from being undercooked, so don't skip it!).Cover and let the dough rise once more for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the oil. You need about 2 inches of oil in a pot. I just used a small 2 quart saucepan, and I was able to fry 2 doughnuts at a time. If you want to fry more doughnuts at a time, simply use a bigger pot with more oil. 4 cups of oil worked perfectly for me. Heat the oil over medium-high heat. It's ready when water droplets make it slightly sizzle.Gently place each doughnut in the oil. Once you see brown begin to creep up the side of the doughnuts, flip them (this should happen pretty quickly, it won't take more than a minute, especially as the oil continues to get hotter).Remove the doughnuts to a wire rack over paper towels to let dry and cool slightly.Whisk together the powdered sugar and milk.

Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. You could try Siduri Sta. Rita Hills Pinot Noir.

Rita Hills Pinot Noir","description":"The 2014 Sta. Rita Hills Pinot Noir is a blend of fruit from the John Sebastiano, Clos Pepe, Cargasacchi, and Lindley Vineyards. The actual blend is 64% John Sebastiano Vineyard Pinot Noir, 22% Clos Pepe, 9% Lindley, and 6% Cargasacchi. Clonally, this wine is a blend of 8 different clones which also provides for a wide range of flavors within one wine. The 2014 Pinot Noir Sta. Rita Hills should be a classic expression of the region, showing lots of spice, red fruit and dried soils aromas and flavors. Balanced, polished and elegant with plenty of fruit, it should certainly be an outstanding wine, and at the price, is an excellent value in Pinot Noir.","price":"$32.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/454206-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8400000000000001,"ratingCount":7,"score":0.7945454545454547,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fsiduri-sta-rita-hills-pinot-noir-2014%2F168102"}]},"instructions":"Marinate the steak: Mix all marinade ingredients. Coat the steak with the marinade and let it sit at room temperature for an hour, or longer in the fridge.\nBefore you cook the meat, wipe off most of the marinade and sprinkle the steak with salt.\n\nSear the steak on both sides: Set a large cast iron pan or griddle over high heat and let this heat up for 1-2 minutes. Add the tablespoon of oil to the pan and let this heat up for 1 minute.\nAdd the steak, frying on each side for 3 minutes, or to desired doneness. 3 minutes per side will yield approximately medium rare doneness for an average cut of flank steak.\n \nCarne asada and skirt steak will need less time. If the pan starts to smoke too much, reduce the heat to medium-high. You want the steak browned, not burned.\nRemove from pan and let sit, tented with foil, for 5 minutes.\n\nCook the vegetables while the meat is resting. Add a little more oil to the pan if necessary, then add the onions and bell peppers.\nLet these sear for 1 minute before stirring, then stir every 90 seconds or so as the veggies sear. Cook for 5-6 minutes total.\n\nSlice the meat across the grain into thin slices. If you slice the meat at an angle, you will be able to get your slices pretty thin. These cuts of steak are flavorful but can be a little tough, so thin slices will really help make it easier to eat.\n\nServe immediately with shredded cheese, salsa, shredded iceberg lettuce, sour cream, guacamole and warm flour tortillas. (Hint for warming tortillas - put in microwave over a paper towel for 20 seconds on high heat.)","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Marinate the steak","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Mix all marinade ingredients.

salt, and pepper and pure until smooth. In large bowl, combine marinade and pheasant and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate overnight or up to 48 hours.                                    Braise pheasant:                                        In very large Dutch oven over moderately high heat, heat olive oil until hot but not smoking. Remove pheasant pieces from marinade, scraping off excess, and sprinkle with salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Working in batches, sear pheasant pieces until well browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towel-lined platter to drain.                                                                            Preheat oven to 325F. Skim off all but 1 tablespoon oil from pan, leaving browned bits at bottom, and set pan over moderately low heat. Add butter and heat until melted. Stir in onions, bay leaf, fennel seeds, salt, remaining 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and sugar. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are well caramelized, 30 to 40 minutes.                                                                            Return pheasant to pot. Add chicken broth, cider, and wine. (Liquid should cover half of pheasant pieces. Add more chicken broth if necessary.) Raise heat to high and bring liquid to simmer. Add apples, cover, and transfer pot to oven. Braise, turning pheasant pieces occasionally, until meat is cooked through and tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.                                                                            Using tongs or slotted spoon, transfer pheasant to platter and cover with foil to keep warm. Set pot over high heat and bring pan juices to boil. Boil, uncovered, until sauce is well reduced and thickened, about 25 minutes. Taste and add additional salt and pepper, if necessary.                                    While juices are reducing, prepare caramelized onions and apples:                                        Bring medium pot of water to boil. Add pearl onions and boil, uncovered, 1 minute. Drain and run under cold water until cool enough to handle; slip off skins.                                                                            In small skillet over moderately high heat, heat oil until hot but not smoking. Add onions, apples, sugar, salt, and pepper and stir to combine. Sear, shaking pan occasionally, until onions and apples are dark golden, about 10 minutes. Stir in apple cider, scraping up any browned bits in pan. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until onions are fork tender, about 2 minutes more.                                    Serve:                                        Spoon some of sauce over pheasant and garnish with onions, apples, and chopped tarragon.
