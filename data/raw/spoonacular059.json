Add the butter, sugar, milk powder, salt and 2 cups flour; beat on low for 3 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.                                                                                             Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl; turn once to grease top.

Yield: 1 dozen.                                                                                                     Editor's Note: The dough may be prepared in a bread machine. Place dough ingredients (using water that is 70°-80° and only 3 cups of bread flour) in bread pan in order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; add 1-2 tablespoons of water or flour if needed). When cycle is completed, turn dough onto a floured surface and punch down.

      Combine yeast, 1/2 teaspoon white sugar, and warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk together and set aside until foamy, about 10 minutes.                            Pour pumpkin puree, cream, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup melted butter, salt, 1/2  teaspoon vanilla, ginger, allspice, 2 cups flour, and the egg into stand mixer bowl with the yeast mixture. Mix with dough hook attachment until combined, about 2 minutes.                            Stir in 2 1/4 cups flour and mix on low with the dough hook, adding more flour if the mixture is too sticky, until dough is slightly sticky, smooth, and elastic, 6 to 7 minutes.                            Remove dough and shape into a ball. Coat the bowl of the stand mixer lightly with vegetable oil, return dough to the bowl, turning to coat with oil. Cover with aluminum foil and set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.                            Generously butter a 13x9-inch baking dish.                            Transfer dough to a well-floured work surface. Use your hands to flatten into a rectangular shape about 1-inch thick. Generously sprinkle flour over both sides of the dough; roll out to about a 20x12-inch rectangle. Pour melted butter over the top and brush evenly over the surface, leaving 2-inches along one wide edge unbuttered. Sprinkle the brown sugar mixture over the dough and moisten the unbuttered edge with water. Starting at the wide edge with butter, roll dough tightly into a log; press firmly along moistened edge to seal.                            Trim uneven ends from the roll and discard. Cut rolled dough into 16 equally-sized pinwheels. Place the pinwheels, cut side up, in the prepared baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, 45 to 60 minutes.                            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).                            Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes; set aside to cool slightly while mixing glaze.                            Whisk cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl until smooth; drizzle over the warm cinnamon rolls. Sprinkle pumpkin seeds over the rolls to serve.

Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti.

Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Using a damp paper towel, lightly scrub and clean the peaches of any extraneous fuzz.

Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Stir the flour, cocoa, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl until well combined, then stir in the dried cherries and chocolate chips. Add the cream and stir until the mixture comes together into a somewhat stiff dough.2. Turn out onto a clean cutting board and, with your hands, press the dough into a 6-inch square about 2 inches thick. With a long, thin knife, cut the dough into 9 (2-inch) squares.3. Dip the tops of the biscuits into the melted butter and then into sugar, pressing lightly so it adheres. Place the biscuits 2 inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for about 15 minutes, or until they’re light gold and spring back when pressed lightly. Set aside at room temperature for up to 4 hours.Make the cherries jubilee4. Combine the cherries and the 1/3 cup kirsch in a bowl and let macerate for 30 minutes, tossing occasionally. Put half of the cherries, the sugar, and lemon juice into a saucepan and simmer over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until the liquid begins to thicken.5. Remove from the heat, add the brandy, and, averting your face, carefully ignite the brandy with a long match. Let burn for about 1 minute to burn off the alcohol, then extinguish the flame by covering the pan. Remove the lid and continue to simmer the cherry mixture until it reduces to a syrup.6. With a slotted spoon, transfer the cherries to a bowl and reserve. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons kirsch to the syrup and set aside or refrigerate for up to 2 days (along with the reserved cherries in a separate container).Make the ice cream7. Split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise and scrape the seeds into a saucepan. Add the vanilla-bean pod, cream, and milk and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes.8. Whisk the sugar and egg yolks in a small bowl just to combine them, then whisk in some of the warm milk mixture until blended. Stir the sugar-and-egg-yolk mixture into the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the custard coats the back of a spoon (when you draw your finger across the back of the spoon, there should be a visible trail that doesn’t immediately flow back together).9. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a container and chill thoroughly, at least 2 hours. Freeze according to the ice cream maker’s instructions. The frozen ice cream should be stored in a tightly covered plastic or stainless-steel container. For the best flavor and texture, let it soften slightly at room temperature before serving.To serve10. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Split the biscuits and put into the oven for about 5 minutes, or until warmed through. Heat the cherry syrup in a small skillet over medium heat, add the reserved cherries and the 2 tablespoons of butter, and swirl the pan until the butter has melted and combined with the syrup.11. Center a warm biscuit bottom on 8 dessert plates or shallow bowls and put equal spoonfuls of the cherries and their syrup on each, reserving a cup or so. Place on a biscuit top, followed by a scoop of ice cream. Dollop the remaining cherries and syrup around or to the side of the biscuits.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the biscuits","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).

combined.  Pour in remaining half and half and heavy cream and heat over medium low heat, stirring frequently until it comes to a small simmer. Turn off the heat. In a separate bowl, whisk egg yolks until pale yellow.  Slowly incorporate granulated sugar until mixture thickens slightly to create ribbons that fall back on itself. Take about 1 cup of the hot milk mixture and whisk it into the eggs to temper. Whisk in another cup, then stir the tempered eggs into the pot. Heat over low heat stirring frequently until mixture reaches 175 degrees. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Strain into a bowl sitting on ice {to cool the mixture quickly}. Refrigerate 24 hours.For the nougat:Melt butter in a small saucepan. Stir in sugar and evaporated milk and cook over medium heat to melt. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer lightly for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in remaining ingredients. Pour onto a parchment paper lined plate or baking sheet. Cool 1-2 hours, then cut into small bite-sized pieces.For the caramel sauce:Place sugar and water into a small saucepan and bring to simmer. Mixture will stay white, then become clear as the sugar melts, then start turning amber in color. Once it turns a light amber, reduce heat and whisk in heavy cream. It will bubble violently at first, but keep whisking and it will all melt together to become a sauce. Stir in butter and vanilla. Pour into a bowl and cool to room temperature.To make the ice cream:Pour chilled chocolate ice cream base into a frozen bowl of ice cream maker and churn 7-10 minutes until smooth and frozen {like soft serve}. Scoop half of the mixture into a large Tupperware container. Top with half the nougat pieces, half the peanuts, half the chopped chocolate and half the caramel sauce.

Pour the milk and cream into a medium saucepan. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise, then scrape the seeds with the blunt side of a small knife and add them to the pan along with the bean and vanilla extract. Add a 1/2 cup of the sugar and place the pan over medium heat.2. Meanwhile, place the egg yolks in a large bowl. Whisk in the remaining 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon sugar, followed by the salt and cornstarch. When the milk mixture comes to a boil, remove the pan from the heat. Slowly pour some of the mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly. Add the rest of the hot liquid to the eggs, whisking constantly, then transfer the mixture back to the saucepan and place it over low heat. Keep whisking it to prevent the custard from scorching or overcooking.3. When the custard has thickened somewhat, remove it from the heat and strain it through a chinois or fine-meshed sieve into a bowl. Place the bowl in a larger bowl of ice water to chill it, whisking occasionally as the custard cools. Press a piece of plastic wrap onto the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate the custard in an airtight container until ready to serve.Make the bomboloni4. Place the warm water in a small bowl and sprinkle the yeast over it. Add a 1/2 teaspoon of the granulated sugar and stir to dissolve the yeast. Set the bowl aside and allow the yeast to proof until foamy, about 4 minutes.5. Place the milk in a small saucepan or a microwaveable container and heat until warm to the touch.6. Place the all-purpose flour, cake flour, remaining 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar, the salt, and spices in the bowl of an electric mixer and use the paddle attachment to combine them thoroughly. Make a well in the center of the bowl and add the yeast mixture, warm milk, and eggs. Beat on medium until a smooth dough forms. Beat in the butter, then remove the paddle and replace with the dough hook, and beat in enough additional flour on low speed to make a smooth, soft, somewhat elastic dough. Switch to medium speed and mix for 2 to 3 minutes.7. Turn the dough into a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in a warm, draft-free spot and allow the dough to rise until doubled, about 2 hours.8. Gently deflate the dough by pulling it from the sides of the bowl and turn it onto a floured surface. Pat or roll the dough to a thickness of about 1/2 inch. Using a fluted or plain-edged round cutter 1 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter, cut the doughnuts. Place them on a baking sheet dusted with flour and cover them with plastic wrap. Allow them to proof while you heat the oil.9. Heat 6 inches (4 to 6 cups) olive oil to 360°F (182°C) in a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Fry the doughnuts in batches, 4 or 5 at a time, in the hot oil, gently turning them until they are golden brown on both sides and cooked in the center.10. Drain the doughnuts on paper towels. While they are still warm, sprinkle them generously with confectioners’ sugar on both sides. The bomboloni are best served warm, with Vanilla Custard alongside for dipping.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the vanilla custard","ingredients":[{"id":19170,"name":"custard","image":"custard.png"},{"id":2050,"name":"vanilla","image":"vanilla.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Pour the milk and cream into a medium saucepan.

Add ground sirloin and stir, breaking up meat with a wooden spoon, until it is evenly browned; about 5 more minutes.To the pan, add tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, and thyme.

Season mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat and use a potato masher to mash the mixture slightly. Allow the beef mixture to cool slightly while you prepare the crust.Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Make sure oven racks are positioned in the upper and lower thirds of the oven.

Dissolve honey and yeast in 3/4 cup warm water in a large bowl. Let stand 5 minutes or until it begins to bubble. Add 2 cups flour and salt to yeast mixture; stir until a soft dough forms. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic- about 6 minutes (or use dough hook on your stand mixer); add enough of the remaining flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, to prevent dough from sticking to hands (dough will feel slightly sticky).2.  Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top. Cover with a clean dishtowel and let rise in a warm place (85°), free from drafts, 30 minutes or until doubled in size. (Gently press two fingers into dough. If the indentation remains, the dough has risen enough.)3.  Roll dough into a 12-inch circle (about 1/4-inch thick) on a lightly floured surface. Place dough on a rimless baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal. Crimp edges of dough with fingers to form a rim. Lightly spray surface of dough with cooking spray, and cover with plastic wrap. Place the dough in refrigerator for up to 30 minutes.4.  To prepare pizza immediately, preheat a baking sheet or baking stone in the oven (on lowest rack) to 500 degrees F.  Remove plastic wrap from the dough; discard and brush 2 teaspoons olive oil on the dough.  Use spatula to slide dough onto preheated baking sheet.  Bake for 8 minutes.  Then spread sauce and desired toppings onto the pre-baked crust.  Move to the middle rack and bake for about 10 more minutes, until crust is golden & cheese melts.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Dissolve honey and yeast in 3/4 cup warm water in a large bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":19296,"name":"honey","image":"honey.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"yeast-granules.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Let stand 5 minutes or until it begins to bubble.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add 2 cups flour and salt to yeast mixture; stir until a soft dough forms.

The wine is concentrated and elegant with a rich mouthfeel and lingering finish.","price":"$33.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/441958-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":7,"score":0.7545454545454546,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fsanctuary-bien-nacido-vineyard-pinot-noir-2007%2F109741"}]},"instructions":"*Be careful frying with hot oil!*Season diced chicken liberally.

Turn tacos after 30 to 45 seconds, or when each side gets light golden brown (not too brown.)One at a time, remove tacos from the pan with tongs, holding sideways as you remove them to allow oil to drip out of the sides. Place the taco in the stack of paper towels. Fold the sides and corners around the taco to tightly hold it, then give it three or four shakes to remove excess oil. Remove it from the paper towels and place on a plate. Repeat with other tacos in the pan. As you continue frying the other tacos, have someone carefully place some grated cheese inside the tops of the tacos (gently pry them open just enough to place the cheese in). Then just let them sit until ready to serve---the cheese will melt as it sits in the warm taco. To serve, garnish in this order: a smear of sour cream, dashes of hot sauce, shredded lettuce, diced tomato. You'll need to slightly open up the tops of the tacos to get all the garnishes in there.

For the Topping: Pulse bread, butter, salt and pepper in food processor until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about ten 1-second pulses. Transfer to a large bowl and toss with onions; set aside.2. For the Beans and Sauce: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees F. Fill a large bowl with ice water. Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add 2 tablespoons salt and beans. Cook beans until bright green and crisp-tender, about 6 minutes. Drain beans in colander and plunge immediately into ice water to stop cooking. Spread beans on paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain.3. Add butter to now-empty pot and melt over medium-high heat until foaming subsides. Add mushrooms, garlic, ¾ teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper; cook until mushrooms release moisture and liquid evaporates, about 6 minutes. Add flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Stir in broth and bring to simmer, stirring constantly. Add cream, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until sauce is thickened and reduced to 3½ cups, about 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.4. Add green beans to sauce and stir until evenly coated. Arrange in an even layer in 3-quart (or 9x13-inch) baking dish. Sprinkle with topping and bake until top is golden brown and sauce is bubbling around edges, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately.*Note 1: You can prep this ahead of time. Store the bread-crumb topping in an airtight container in the refrigerator and combine with the onions just before cooking. Combine the beans and cooled sauce in a baking dish, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. To serve, remove the plastic wrap and heat the casserole in a 425-degree oven for 10 minutes, then add the topping and bake as directed.*Note 2: This recipe can be halved and baked in a 2-quart (or 8-inch square) baking dish. If making a half batch, reduce the cooking time of the sauce in Step 3 to about 6 minutes (1¾ cups) and the baking time in Step 4 to 10 minutes.*Note 3: If you want to go 100% homemade and eliminate the canned fried onions, you can make your own caramelized onions. Thinly slice 2 sweet onions and saute in 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and sprinkle with salt and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes, or until the onions are golden, caramelized and soft. Set aside to cool before combining with remainder of crumb topping. Proceed with the recipe as directed.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the Topping: Pulse bread, butter, salt and pepper in food processor until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about ten 1-second pulses.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"food-processor.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Transfer to a large bowl and toss with onions; set aside.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"For the Beans and Sauce: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees F.
