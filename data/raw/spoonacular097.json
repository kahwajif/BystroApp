bowl. Cover the bowl and let it sit in a warm place (like inside of a turned off oven) for about 30 minutes. It'll be ready when it 'bubbles'.In the bowl of a standing mixer, using the paddle on low speed, mix together the rest of the flour, mashed potato, butter salt and sugar until it has taken on a grainy consistency. Then start adding the eggs, one by one. Stop the mixer and add the proofed yeast, then continue until you've achieved a uniform, very stick dough.Grease a ring mold very well. (NB: Do this even if you're ring mold is supposedly non-stick; trust me, it helps.) Gather up the dough into a ball with a spatula and place it in the mold, evening it out as much as you can. The sticky dough can be hard to handle, but persist; it is easiest to use your hands for the operation.Cover the mold with a towel and let is sit for an hour or two, until it has at least doubled in volume, filling up the mold.Preheat the oven to 180C/350F.  Place the mold (uncovered) in the oven and bake for 20-30 minutes, until the dough has turned golden brown on top and a paring knife or toothpick inserted into it comes out perfectly clean. Remove from the oven and let the cake cool in its mold for about 10-15 minutes.While the cake is cooling, make the syrup: Add water and sugar in a  saucepan and bring to a boil. Simmer for about a minute, then add a good splash (or two) of rum. Simmer for another minute or so. (NB: If it's more convenient to make the syrup ahead of time, make sure to reheat it before proceeding to the next step.)After the cake has cooled off a bit but is still warm, prick the top of the babà all over with a paring knife or other sharp object to perforate the surface. Spoon the rum syrup, little by little, all over the top of the cake and around the edges, too, so it runs down the sides and reaches the bottom of the mold. Continue until you've used up all but a few spoonfuls of the syrup. (If garnishing the babà with mixed berries, save another spoonful for that, too.) Let the cake sit in its mold for another 10-15 minutes to allow the syrup to penetrate it completely.Turn the cake over on to a serving platter and unmold it. Spoon the remaining syrup over the top, and fill the center, if you like, with crema pasticcera, whipped cream or mixed berries.

middle position and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.                          For the crust: Brush a 10-inch springform pan with some of the melted butter. Stir together the remaining butter with the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and salt in a medium bowl. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and 1 inch up the side of the pan. Use the back of a measuring cup or a drinking glass to pack the crust firmly and evenly into the edges of the pan. Bake until browned, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cool completely, then set the pan on top of a large sheet of aluminum foil and wrap the foil around the bottom of the pan and up the sides. Place the pan on a baking sheet.                          For the filling: Beat the cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed for 1 minute. Add the sour cream, and mix until just combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the cream and vanilla extract, and mix until just combined. Beat in the eggs one at time, beating the mixture after the last egg until just combined (take care not to overmix or the cake will turn into a souffle).                          Pour the filling in to the crust. Bake until the cheesecake is slightly golden and barely set in the middle when the pan is tapped, about 1 hour and 20 minutes (the cake might puff up slightly while in the oven, but that is okay; it will deflate as it cools). Turn off the oven, and leave the cake inside with the door shut for 1 hour. It will continue to set and color slightly in the oven.                          Run a thin knife or spatula around the cake to release it from the sides (this also helps reduce cracks in the top of the cake as it chills). Cover the cheesecake with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.                          For the cranberry compote: Stir the sugar, dried cranberries and 1 cup water together in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and then add the fresh cranberries. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until most of the fresh cranberries have burst and the sauce is slightly thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the compote to a heat-safe bowl and let it cool slightly before covering the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerating until it is completely chilled. The cranberry sauce will thicken as it cools. (This can be made up to one day in advance.)                          For serving: Spread the cranberry compote in an even layer on top of the chilled cheesecake. The cheesecake will sink a bit in the center as it cools so it creates a perfect well for the cranberry compote. Run a thin knife or spatula between the cake and the sides again, then release the sides of the springform pan and remove the ring from the cheesecake base. Set the base on a cake platter, slice and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Special equipment: A 10-inch springform pan","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404650,"name":"springform pan","image":"cake-pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":325,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]}]},{"name":"For the crust","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Brush a 10-inch springform pan with some of the melted butter.

of each lemon to expose the flesh. Cutting from top to bottom and following the contours of the fruit, cut off the peel and white pith in 1-inch-wide strips. Scrape off any pulp adhering to the strips, but leave the pith intact. You should have several 1-inch wide strips of lemon peel and pith. Cut each 1 into long strips, about 1/4-inch by 3 inches each.                          Meanwhile, boil a kettleful of water. Pour about 2 cups of the boiling water into a small saucepan, bring back to a boil, add all the lemon rind, and boil 30 seconds. Drain in a strainer and rinse under cold running water. Repeat 2 times more, using fresh boiling water each time. Combine the sugar and 2 cups of water in the saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the blanched rind and reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer until tender, about 1 hour.                          Drain in a strainer (reserve the sweet, lemony syrup for sweetening drinks, if you like). Arrange the strips on a wire rack, using your fingers to gently spread them out so that they do not touch each other. Let cool and store in an airtight container.                          To make the crust: Cream the butter until soft and smooth in a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add the sugar and continue creaming until light and fluffy. Mix in the egg and the vanilla. In a separate bowl, stir together the dry ingredients. Add the dry ingredients to the mixer and mix at low speed until almost blended. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead briefly, just until the dough comes together. Form into a disk and chill at least 2 hours or overnight.                          Flour a work surface. Roll out the dough 1/8-inch thick and prick all over with a fork. Use a cutter to cut out rounds of pastry that are slightly larger in diameter than your mini-muffin cups. Transfer the pastry rounds to a sheet pan and chill 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and bake until light golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let cool.                          Butter 2 mini-muffin tins and then lay a large piece of heavy duty plastic wrap over the tin. Push the plastic wrap down into each cup (this is to line it very well). Do not worry, the plastic wrap will not burn or melt in the oven. Heat the oven to 375 degrees F.                          To make the filling: Whip the cream cheese until light and fluffy in a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Add the sugar and mix. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, then the flour and salt. Divide the filling among the lined cups, filling each one all the way up. Bake for 20 minutes. Let cool to room temperature, then chill.                          When ready to serve, cut the plastic wrap so you can remove each cup of cheesecake individually. Lift each one out of the cup and invert onto a cornmeal crust. Peel off the plastic wrap. When all the cakes have been assembled, top each one with a tiny mound of chopped lemon confit and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"To make the confit","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut a slice off the top and bottom of each lemon to expose the flesh.","ingredients":[{"id":9150,"name":"lemon","image":"lemon.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Cutting from top to bottom and following the contours of the fruit, cut off the peel and white pith in 1-inch-wide strips.

meat across the grain).Put the pork in a bowl and add the soy sauce, hoisin sauce and sesame seed oil.Mix well.Add the cornstarch.Mix well. Cover and allow to marinate in the fridge for about 30 minutes.Meanwhile, start making the sauce.Over medium-mow heat, heat up the 2 tbsps. of vegetable cooking oil in a pan. Add the ginger and garlic and cook, still over medium-low heat, until fragrant. Should take a couple of minutes. Don’t wait for the ginger and garlic to brown.Pour in the rice wine and soy sauce. Add the chopped chili and sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.Turn up the heat to medium high and allow the sauce to boil gently until it acquires a syrupy consistency, about ten minutes. Taste the sauce. If you want it more salty or sweet, stir in some salt (more soy sauce will make the sauce too dark) or more sugar, as needed. Set aside.Heat the 1 and 1/2 c. of cooking oil in a wok or frying pan. I don’t use a thermometer but the ideal temperature for frying is between 350F to 375F. You can test the temperature by dropping a piece of bread into the oil. If the bread sinks, the oil isn’t hot enough. If it browns in less than five seconds, it’s too hot.Over medium high heat, fry the pork in batches. Do not overcrowd the pan. Cook ten to 12 pieces at a time to maintain the temperature of the oil. If the pork slices are thin enough, each batch should cook in four to five minutes.Drain the fried pork on a stack of paper towels as each batch cooks.When all the pork is done, gently reheat the sauce. This is a caramelized sauce and, as with anything caramelized, it would have thickened considerably as it cooled. You want to make it thin enough to coat the pork pieces with. So, reheat gently. Once it has thinned to a syrupy consistency again, add the pork to the sauce, stir and toss alternately until all the pork pieces are coated with the rich sticky sauce.Sprinkle the pork with finely sliced scallions (green onions) and serve on top of steaming rice.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Slice the pork thinly (1/4 inch thin or thinner) across the grain (see how to slice meat across the grain).","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Put the pork in a bowl and add the soy sauce, hoisin sauce and sesame seed oil.","ingredients":[{"id":4058,"name":"sesame oil","image":"sesame-oil.png"},{"id":6175,"name":"hoisin sauce","image":"dark-sauce.jpg"},{"id":16124,"name":"soy sauce","image":"soy-sauce.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Mix well.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the cornstarch.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Mix well.

It costs about 21 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442678,"title":"Felsina Chianti Colli Senesi","description":"Deep ruby with violet hues.

First, make the pizza dough. In a glass measuring cup or small bowl, combine yeast and 1 cup warm water. Add a pinch of sugar and let sit for 5 minutes.2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the flour and salt. Mix the ingredients until combined.3. Add the yeast mixture to the flour mixture. Next, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Mix until combined. Switch to the dough hook and knead for about 5 minutes on medium speed.4. Spray a large bowl with cooking spray. Form dough into a ball and place in the bowl. Cover pizza dough with a damp towel and set in a warm area to rise. Let the dough rise for 1 hour or until dough has doubled in size.5. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Cut the dough in half. Take one piece of dough and punch it down on a lightly floured surface. You can refrigerate or freeze the other half of the dough or make 2 pizzas, if you wish. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out into a circle. Place the pizza dough on a pizza pan or pizza stone. 6. Evenly brush the olive oil on the pizza. Top with fresh mozzarella slices. Add the parmesan cheese. Place the pizza in the oven and bake for 12-15 minutes or until pizza crust is golden and cheese is melted.7. Remove the pizza from the oven and place arugula on top. Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the arugula and season with salt and black pepper, to taste. Garnish with additional parmesan cheese, if desired.
