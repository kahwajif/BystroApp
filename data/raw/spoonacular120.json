Spray two 8x4-inch loaf pans with floured cooking spray or lightly grease and flour the pans; set aside. Recipe may be baked in one 9x5 pan, as 4 mini loaves, or as muffins, although I have not tested it that way. Adjust baking time accordingly. Cherry Bread - Remove cherries from jar and place on a cutting board. Roughly chop them. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons flour (prevents them from sinking during baking) and toss to coat evenly; set cutting board aside. Set jar with the cherry juice aside. In a large mixing bowl, add 1 3/4 cups flour, sugar, baking powder, optional salt, and whisk to combine; set aside. In a small mixing bowl or glass measuring cup, combine eggs, oil, all the cherry juice from the jar except 1/4 cup to be reserved for the glaze, almond extract, vanilla extract, and whisk to combine. Pour wet mixture over dry ingredients and stir to combine; don't overmix. Batter will be very thick. Lightly fold in the chopped cherries. Turn batter out into the prepared pans, smoothing the tops lightly with a spatula. Strategically place a few cherries on top for visual appeal. Bake for about 40 minutes, or until bread is domed, set, springy to the touch, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, or with a few moist crumbs, but no batter. Allow bread to cool in pans on top of a wire rack for about 15 minutes before removing and allowing to finish cooling completely on rack. While bread cools, make the glaze. Cherry-Almond Glaze - In a medium bowl, combine 1/4 cup reserved cherry juice, almond extract, about 1 cup confectioners' sugar, and whisk to combine until smooth and satiny. Add sugar until desired consistency is reached. Glaze the bread prior to serving. After the photos were done, I glazed much more liberally, spreading the glaze like butter on the interior of the slices. Bread will keep airtight at room temp for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 6 months. Do not glaze bread until ready to serve if you plan on storing long-term.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350F.

The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.\n\nQuintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

Stir intermittently using a rubber spatula. As the butter melts it will start to bubble and foam. As the butter continues to brown, the color will turn from lemon yellow to amber and go from a loud bubble to quiet simmer. When the butter is ready, brown specks will have formed at the bottom of the pan and some will start rise in the foam. The butter will also have a very pleasant nutty aroma. While butter is browning line a 9x13 pan with parchment paper, foil seems to stick. Set aside an additional piece of parchment paper to place the finished treats on. Transfer the rice crisp cereal to an extra large mixing bowl and set aside.Once the butter has browned, add the vanilla, and salt to the pan. Then add all of the marshmallows except for the 1 cup that's been reserved. Use a rubber spatula to stir the ingredients together until combined. Remove from heat. Using the rubber spatula transfer the marshmallow mixture to the cereal bowl, then add the remaining 1 cup of marshmallows. Stir everything together until combined.Transfer the cereal mixture to the pan lined with parchment paper. Use the spatula to spread and press the cereal mixture into place evenly across the pan. It may also help to use wet hands to push the mixture into the pan. Let cool for 30 minutes or until hardened.Once the cereal treats are cooled, lift the parchment from the pan and cut the treats into heart shapes using a 3\" metal heart shaped cookie cutter. Alternate between cutting right-side up on one row and upside down on the next row to maximize space. To get a very clean cut, trace a knife  around the cookie cutter a few times. Peel back the parchment paper underneath and remove the treat from the pan. Press the treat through one side of the cookie cutter to remove and set it on the other piece of parchment paper.Once all the treats have been cut, prepare the dipping chocolate. Melt the chocolate chips and coconut oil in a large heat-proof glass or metal mixing bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Stir intermittently, using a rubber spatula, until the chocolate and coconut oil are completely melted and combined.Dip half of each treat into the melted chocolate, place back on the parchment paper and garnish with sprinkles.

set aside.                          Make the special sauce: Whisk the mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, chipotle and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the prepared spice blend in a medium bowl until smooth; refrigerate until ready to use.                          Make the toppings: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, undisturbed, until browned on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Add the onion and season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm.                          Grill the burgers: Preheat a grill to medium and brush the grates with vegetable oil. Form the beef into four 1-inch-thick patties and season generously with the spice blend. Grill until the bottoms are sizzling and browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Flip and cook 5 more minutes for medium.

Place chilis in a heat-proof bowl.  Cover with boiling water, set a plate on top of the bowl and set aside.Heat olive oil in a large, steep sided skillet over medium heat.

Discard chili soaking water.Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.  Cook for 15 minutes, or until sauce has slightly thickened.  Taste and add salt if necessary.  If sauce is spicy enough, remove chilis.Place sauce in your VitaMix or blender.  Remove the plug in the top of the blender and cover with a kitchen towel.  This allows steam to escape and will save your blender from blowing it’s top.  Start on low and increase to medium high, pureeing until smooth.  Return to sauce pan and keep warm.Preheat oven to 350F.  Use one 9×13 baking dish or two smaller 8×8 baking dishes.  Wrap 12 corn tortillas in aluminum foil and heat in oven for 10 minutes.  Increase heat to 450F when you remove tortillas.Heat olive oil over medium heat.  Add onions and cook until translucent, 5 – 8 minutes.  Add garlic and cook for another minute, until fragrant.  Add mushrooms and cook until soft.  Move onion mixture to the side of the skillet and brown ground turkey, stirring onion mixture in as turkey cooks. Season to taste with salt and pepper.Set up an assembly line of sorts with your warm tortillas, shredded cheese, turkey & mushroom mixture, and dishes.  Cover the bottom the baking dish with sauce. Put a tablespoon or so of cheese down the middle of the tortilla then fill with a generous 1/4 cup of turkey.  Fold the sides in and place seam side down in the baking dish.  Repeat with remaining tortillas.  Cover with enchilada sauce, top with remaining cheese, and bake for 15 – 20 minutes, until bubbly and cheese is lightly browned.

Sift the flour, confectioners' sugar and salt onto a sheet of parchment paper. Sift again, then set aside.                          Beat the egg whites in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until frothy. Add the cream of tartar and beat until soft peaks form, about 5 minutes. Gradually beat in the granulated sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time, then increase the speed to medium high and continue beating until stiff, shiny peaks form, 12 to 15 minutes. Add the vanilla, lime zest and ginger and beat a few seconds to combine.                          Sprinkle one-quarter of the flour mixture over the egg mixture and gently fold with a rubber spatula. Fold in the remaining flour mixture in 3 additions. Transfer the batter to an ungreased 10-inch tube pan. Bake until the cake feels springy and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Invert the pan onto a funnel or the neck of a bottle and cool completely. Loosen the edges with a small knife, tap the sides of the pan against the counter and unmold.                          Make the sauce: Puree 2 half pints raspberries in a blender with 2 tablespoons water, the granulated sugar, lime zest and lime juice. Strain to remove the seeds.

The remaining third of the sauce will be for the marinade.\n\nMarinate the steak: Place steak in a bowl or large ziplock bag. Take about a third of the prepared chimichurri sauce and coat the steak for a marinade.\nCover completely with plastic wrap or remove air from ziplock bag and secure close.

Add the olive oil and eggs and mix together until it comes together into a ball. Attach the bowl to a mixer fitted with a dough hook and knead until the dough is smooth and satiny. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest while you make the filling.Blanch the arugula by putting it in a glass container, adding about a tablespoon of water, covering with another glass plate, and microwaving for 1 minute. Remove the lid, let it cool enough to handle, then squeeze as much moisture out of it as you can.Heat a small saute pan and add the olive oil. Saute the shallots, garlic and shiitake mushrooms until the mushrooms have given up most of their moisture (about 10-15 minutes). Let this mixture cool down to room temperature.Add the arugula, onion mixture, marscapone, ricotta, tahini, soy sauce and salt to a food processor and process until smooth. Add the water chestnuts and pulse a few times to roughly chop them up (there should still be chunks). Prepare an egg wash by whisking together an egg with 1 tablespoon of water.Heat the balsamic vinegar, honey and demi-glace in your smallest sauce pan. Once the demi-glace has disolved and the mixture is thick and bubbly, it's ready (this shouldn't take long). I poured the mixture into a mini squeeze bottle to make the dots, but you can also just pour a bit on the plate and smear it with a spoon, or just drizzle it on top of the raviolis.Cut off a quarter of the dough and flatten it out on a floured surface using your hands or a rolling pin, then pass it through the rollers of a pasta maker starting from the thickest setting and working your way down to a thinnest, passing the dough through at least 2 times per setting. If the dough starts to stick, just dust some flour on it. Lay the dough out on a long flat floured surface then repeat with another quarter of dough.When your second sheet is done, line the sheets up and trim off the ends so they are exactly the same length. Place 1 tablespoon of filling a few inches apart, leaving room around the edges of the dough so you can seal the raviolis. Be careful not to overcrowd the dough or you'll have a hard time sealing the raviolis properly. Use a pastry brush to paint the egg wash all around the filling. Drape the other piece of dough over the first piece and use your fingers to start sealing each ravioli starting from one end. It's crucial that there aren't any air pockets with the filling as the air will expand while cooking and your ravioli will burst. The best way to do this is to seal one side, then use two fingers to trace the outline of the filling starting fromt he side that's sealed, then seal off the other side, and you should be good.I used a round cookie cutter that's 1/4\" bigger than the filling mound on both sides, but you can also cut your ravioli with a knife. If you are freezing the ravioli, place them on a floured cookie sheet and freeze them. Once they are frozen you can put them in a ziplock bag, but they will stick together if you don't freeze them separately first.To cook the ravioli, bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil, then turn down the heat to maintain a gentle boil. If you have a very large pot you can cook all 18 at the same time, but I just cooked them in two batches. Drop the raviolis in and then they float to the surface they are done (this won't take very long). Drain the ravioli and transfer them to a bowl. Drizzle with sesame oil, add a handful of arugula, and sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Serve the ravioli with the balsamic vinegar reduction. Sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds and chives on top to garnish.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Put the flour and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer and whisk together.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404628,"name":"hand mixer","image":"hand-mixer.png"},{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the olive oil and eggs and mix together until it comes together into a ball.

Add in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.  When hot, add in the onion.  Cook for about 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft.  Add in the garlic and cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant.  Add in the broccoli florets and the remaining ½ tablespoon of the olive oil.  Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, until bright green.  Add in the broth, thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper.  Partially cover the pot with the lid and then bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for about 6 to 8 minutes, until the broccoli is tender.  Add the spinach leaves to the pot (you may need to do this in two batches).  Continue to cook until wilted, about 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat.Very carefully, puree the soup in a blender until smooth (you’ll need to do this in batches).  Return the soup to the pot.  Taste and add additional salt/pepper if needed (I typically add about a ½ teaspoon additional salt, but it will depend on the broth you use).  Ladle the soup into bowls.  Stir in some chopped walnuts and cheese into each bowl. To make a spiderweb - add a few tablespoons of greek yogurt to a small bowl.  Add in a tablespoon or so of milk.  Mix together until completely smooth.  You want it to be a consistency that is liquidy enough to squeeze out of the bottle, but not too runny.  How much milk you will need to add will vary depending upon how thick your greek yogurt is (I’d say it is about 2 to 3 parts yogurt to 1 part milk but just use your judgement).  Transfer the mixture to a squeeze bottle.  Make three circles (one inside the other) on the top of the soup.  Drag a toothpick through the circles, starting from the center and moving outward, to make a spiderweb.
