Lightly grease a 13-by-18-inch jelly-roll pan; line with parchment paper, letting it come up the short sides by about 2 inches. Brush the paper with oil or melted butter and lightly dust with flour.                          For the filling, whisk the evaporated milk, 1 cup sugar, 3 egg yolks and the cubed butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until thick and creamy, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla, the coconut and pecans. Set aside to cool completely, stirring occasionally.                          Meanwhile, whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk the cocoa and chocolate in another bowl. Add the hot coffee to the cocoa mixture, stirring until smooth; stir in the buttermilk and the remaining 2 teaspoons vanilla.                          Using a mixer, beat the softened butter and the remaining 1 1/4 cups sugar in a large bowl on high speed until fluffy, about 4 minutes. Reduce the speed to low; add the 3 whole eggs, 1 at a time, incorporating each before adding the next. Add the flour mixture in 3 parts, alternating with the cocoa mixture in 2 parts, beginning and ending with the flour. Beat until just blended; if necessary, fold the batter together with a rubber spatula.                          Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan. Bake until the cake springs back when pressed lightly, about 16 minutes. Cool slightly in the pan.                          Run a knife around the edge and slide the cake with its paper onto a work surface. Spread the coconut filling evenly over the cake. Roll the cake from one of the short ends, pulling it away from the parchment into a tight cylinder; transfer to a platter. Cool completely and dust with the confectioners' sugar or cocoa.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.

The 2014 growing season brought a relatively dry summer which resulted in a fuller-bodied wine with fruit-forward characteristics of ripe cherry, blackberry and raspberry character with overtones of earth, mocha and spice. Sunny days and cool nights combined to form a well-rounded Pinot Noir with fresh flavors and healthy acidity. In the realm of Pinot Noir, the 2014 Reserve brings a little more intensity of flavor while still remaining elegant from the native yeast fermentation.","price":"$31.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/468085-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":12,"score":0.7729729729729731,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fmontinore-reserve-pinot-noir-2014%2F320519"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees.In a large pot, bring water to boil and cook egg noodles according to package directions.In a large skillet, brown chicken.

Add remaining sauce ingredients, bring up to a simmer, and remove from heat.When mixture has cooled a bit, taste and adjust salt if necessary. Blend the sauce with an immersion blender until smooth (I just poured the mix into my regular blender and used that it makes far less of a splattery mess than the immersion blender).Make the filling: Preheat the oven to 375F (190C).Start a large pot of water to boil on the stove. Peel potatoes if you like (I leave the skins on for taste and texture) and chop them into 1-inch cubes. Add to potatoes boiling water and boil until tender, about 15 minutes, then drain, mash a bit with a fork, and set aside.Over a medium-low flame, heat olive oil until it shimmers. Add garlic and cook for one minute, stirring constantly.Add kale, carrots, peas, and corn, and sprinkle with a little sea salt. Increase burner level to medium, stirring constantly to mix kale, oil, and garlic. Cover and steam for about five minutes, until greens are wilted.Remove lid and mix in potatoes, mashing a bit more as you go. You want it loose, but with nice potato-y chunks. Add veggie broth, lime juice, cumin, pumpkin seeds, salt, and pepper, cooking another four minutes, until the stock is absorbed. Add more stock or lime juice to taste, then remove from heat.Assemble the enchiladas: Pour about 3/4 cup of enchilada sauce into a pie plate or deep dinner plate. Create an assembly line in this order: lightly oiled hot cast iron pan for softening tortillas, plate with sauce, filling, and the baking dish where youll be putting your finished enchiladas.Ladle a little sauce into the baking dish and spread it around to lightly cover the bottom. Take a corn tortilla, set it into the hot cast iron pan for 20 seconds, then flip it over and repeat. Once the tortilla is soft and pliable, drop it into the pie plate to completely coat it in sauce, then flip and repeat.Place tortilla in baking dish and run a generous amount of potato filling down the center, rolling it up and placing it in the dish. Continue with the rest of the tortillas, leaving about a quarter inch between them so that they will be easier to plate.Pour 1 1/2 cups of sauce over the top of the enchiladas, reserving the rest for later. Cover tightly with foil and bake for 25 minutes, then remove foil and bake for another ten minutes to brown the edges of tortillas.Allow to cool slightly before serving (theyll be hot!) and top with a little more enchilada sauce and a dollop of vegan cilantro sour cream.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the sauce: In a large, heavy bottom sauce pan, saute onion in olive oil over medium heat until soft  about five minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Add remaining sauce ingredients, bring up to a simmer, and remove from heat.When mixture has cooled a bit, taste and adjust salt if necessary.

Stir until well combined. Your dough should hold its shape when pressed, but not feel dry. I found that 1.5 cups was about the perfect amount, but this will depend on your blend.Cover and chill dough for at least one hour, preferably overnight.Preheat oven to 350 degrees.Carefully roll out dough to a little thicker than 1/8 inch between two sheets of plastic wrap or parchment/wax paper, generously sprinkling the bottom layer and the top of the dough with white or brown rice flour before rolling. You don't want it too thin or they'll be too crisp.Remove top sheet and, working quickly, dip your cookie cutters in rice flour and cut out shapes. Next, lift the plastic wrap (with all of the dough) and place it on a baking sheet or large plate and freeze for 5 minutes to let them firm up. This will make them easier to transfer to your baking sheet for baking.Next, use a lightly floured spatula to carefully transfer the cookies to a baking sheet, working quickly. Leave 2 inches for spreading.Bake for 8-10 minutes or until they appear only slightly browned on the edges. They'll continue firming up as they sit on the pan. Let rest on the pan for 2-3 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack.Once cooled, decorate with frosting or sprinkle with powdered sugar.

What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.\n\nQuintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

Try pairing with Chardonnay, Muscadet, and Riesling. Buttery chardonnay is great for scallops, shrimp, crab, and lobster, while muscadet is a classic pick for mussels, oysters, and clams.

The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.\n\nQuintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.
