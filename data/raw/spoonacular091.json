the bottom of a large (16 quart) pot, and place the jars on the rack.\nFill the pot with water to the rim of the jars. (Note if you don't have a level steamer rack you can put a clean dish towel at the bottom of the pot, you just don't want the jars touching the bottom of the pot or they may break from the heat.) Bring to a rolling boil and boil for 10 minutes.\nTo sterilize the lids, place lids in a large bowl and pour boiling water over them.\n\nBoil vinegar, water, salt, and sugar: Place vinegar, water, salt, and sugar in a medium saucepan, bring to a boil to dissolve the salt and sugar, reduce heat and keep warm.\n\nPrep okra: While the water is heating in step one, prepare the okra and the spices. Rinse the okra and trim the stem ends to 1/4-inch.\n\nPlace all pickling spices in a small bowl and stir to combine.\n\nPut lemon slices, spices, garlic in hot jars: Lay out a clean towel on your counter. Use canning tongs to remove the jars from the boiling water, emptying the water from the jars.\nPlace the hot, sterilized jars on the towel on your counter. Placing the hot jars on a towel will help prevent them from getting shocked by a cold counter surface and potentially cracking.\nPlace a lemon slice at the bottom of each jar. Add a tablespoon of the mixed pickling spices to each jar. Place a peeled garlic clove on top of the spices and lemon.\n\nPack okra in the jars: Pack the okra in the jars, alternating stem-side-up and stem-side-down to allow you to pack the okra well into the jars. The top of the okra should come between an inch to 1/2 an inch from the rim of the jar.\n\nPour vinegar mixture over the okra: Pour the hot vinegar mixture over the jars, up to 1/4-inch from the rim of the jars. Run a thin knife between the okra and the jars to dislodge any obvious air bubbles.\n\nOkra is filled with air, so while you run the knife between the okra and the jars, air bubbles will be released from within the okra as well. If the top level of the pickling liquid lowers while you do this, just top off with more of the pickling liquid.\nIf for any reason you don't have enough pickling liquid for all the jars, just add equal amounts of cider vinegar and water. No need to heat first, the liquid will get boiled in the hot water bath.\n\nWipe rims, screw lids on jars: Wipe the rims with a clean damp towel. Place sterilized lids on jars. Screw on the the lids, firmly, but not too tight.\n\nBoil the okra filled jars: Place packed jars back in the pot with water you used to sterilize the jars. The water should still be hot. Because you are putting back in full jars, rather than empty jars, some water will be displaced. Allow for 1 to 2 inches of water to cover the jars. Beyond that you may want to remove excess water.\nBring to a boil and process for 15 minutes. Remove to towel lined counter or to a rack (you want to avoid putting a hot jar on a cold surface, or else the jar might crack.)\n\nLet jars cool: As the jars cool, you should hear a popping sound as the vacuum created by the cooling air in the jars pulls the lid down and seals the jars. A properly sealed jar can last in a cool closet out of direct sun for about a year.\nIf any jars do not seal, store them chilled in the refrigerator. Opened jars should last one to two months in the refrigerator.\nLet sit 24 hours before eating.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare for canning by sterilizing jars and lids: Put a steamer rack at the bottom of a large (16 quart) pot, and place the jars on the rack.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Fill the pot with water to the rim of the jars.

Line a 8-inch springform tin with clingfilm/clingwrap, both in the bottom and sides of the tin so that you have some overhang at the top.                          Empty the slightly softened ice cream into a bowl and mix in the peanuts, 150g/1 cup chocolate and peanut morsels or chips, Crunchie shards/honeycomb shards and 100g/1 cup of the Bourbon biscuit crumbs/chocolate cookie crumbs.                          Scrape the ice cream mixture into the springform tin flattening the top like a cake, and cover the top with clingfilm/clingwrap and place in the freezer to firm up.                          Serve the cake straight from the freezer, unmould from the tin and pulling the clingfilm/clingwrap gently away before putting on a plate or cake stand.                          Sprinkle the top of the cake with the extra 50g/1/4 cup of chocolate and peanut morsels or chips, and the remaining Bourbon biscuit crumbs/chocolate cookie crumbs.

or two. In a medium-sized pot, combine the rinsed quinoa and 1 cup water. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then cover the pot, reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes. Remove the quinoa from heat and let it rest, still covered, for 5 minutes. Uncover the pot, drain off any excess water and fluff the quinoa with a fork. Set it aside to cool.To cook the edamame: Bring a pot of water to boil, then add the frozen edamame and cook just until the beans are warmed through, about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.To toast the almonds or pepitas: In a small skillet over medium heat, toast the almonds or pepitas, stirring frequently, until they are fragrant and starting to turn golden on the edges, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large serving bowl to cool.To prepare the beet(s) and/or carrot: First of all, feel free to just chop them as finely as possible using a sharp chef's knife OR grate them on a box grater. If you have a spiralizer, you can spiralize them using blade C, then chop the ribbons into small pieces using a sharp chef's knife. If you have a mandoline and julienne peeler (this is a pain), use the mandoline to julienne the beet and use a julienne peeler to julienne the carrot, then chop the ribbons into small pieces using a sharp chef's knife.To prepare the vinaigrette: Whisk together all of the ingredients until emulsified.To assemble the salad: In your large serving bowl, combine the toasted almonds/pepitas, cooked edamame, prepared beet(s) and/or carrot, roughly chopped spinach/arugula (see note above about leftovers), cubed avocado and cooked quinoa. Finally, drizzle dressing over the mixture (you might not need all of it) and gently toss to combine. You'll end up with a pink salad if you toss it really well!

For the sauce: Heat the oil in a saucepan on the stove and fry the onion, bell pepper and chiles. Add the salt and cook gently for 15 minutes, and once soft, add the chopped cilantro stalks.                          Add the canned tomatoes then rinse the cans out with water and add this too. Spoon in the ketchup and let things come to a simmer, leaving the sauce (or salsa in keeping with the Mexican mojo) to cook while you get on with preparing the filling- about 10 minutes.                          For the filling: Mix the drained beans and canned corn in a bowl. Add most of the grated cheese, reserving some to sprinkle on the top at the end, and mix together.                          Start to assemble the lasagne by spooning about a third of the salsa into the bottom of your ovenproof dish and smear it about, then layer on 2 tortillas so that they cover the sauce overlapping slightly, like a Venn diagram.                          Add a third of the beans and cheese mixture covering the tortillas, and then about a quarter of the remaining salsa and another 2 tortillas.                          Repeat with another third of beans and cheese, and more salsa before layering on another 2 tortillas.                          Finally, add the last layer of beans and cheese, nearly all of the remaining salsa and cover with the last 2 tortillas. Spread the very last bit of salsa over the tortillas and sprinkle with the remaining cheese.                          Bake for 30 minutes, and let it rest for a good 10 to 15 minutes before slicing like a pizza, and eat with the avocado salsa.                          Halve the avocados, remove the pits, and then, using the tip of a sharp knife, cut lines down the flesh of each half, about a 1/4-inch apart and then the same across. Turn the avocado halves inside out, or otherwise release the pale green cubes into a bowl, then tumble in the scallion, chopped jalepenos, salt to taste, lime juice and most of the cilantro and toss gently to mix.

Divide dough into two pieces and form each into a ball by holding it with well-floured hands and tucking the dough underneath itself, rotating it until it forms a tight ball.                                                                                                                            4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Pour 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil in the bottom of two 10-inch cast iron skillet or round cake pans. (See note above). Place 1 ball of dough in each pan and turn to coat evenly with oil. Using a flat palm, press the dough around the pan, flattening it slightly and spreading oil around the entire bottom and edges of the pan. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough sit at room temperature for two hours. After the first hour, adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat oven to 550°F.                                                                                                                            5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 After two hours, dough should be mostly filling in the pan up to the edges. Use your fingertips to press it around until it fills in every corner, popping any large bubbles that appear.

rice flour, tapioca flour, potato starch, xanthan gum and salt.                          For the cookies: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar and vanilla on medium-high speed until light and smooth.                          Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the almond flour and salt with 2 cups gluten-free flour blend. Add to the butter mixture and beat on low speed until just combined. Divide the dough in half and flatten each to make 2 disks; wrap in plastic wrap and chill until slightly firm, at least 20 minutes.                          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Working with one dough disk at a time, on a surface dusted with some gluten-free flour blend, roll out the dough to about 1/4-inch thickness. Using cookie cutters, cut out cookies and place on the prepared baking sheets; refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes. Bake until the edges are golden, about 10 minutes.

The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.\nThis wine has a broad range of food pairings, whether alone with some well chosen cheeses, richer fish preparations or a good old steak on the barbeque.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438099-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":8,"score":0.82,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fdutton-goldfield-dutton-ranch-pinot-noir-2014%2F154141"}]},"instructions":"Tacos al Pastor:Remove stem and seeds from guajillo chile pods and place pods in hot water for about 15 minutes to soften.In a blender, combine the softened guajillo chile pods, chipotle chiles, adobo sauce, oil, juice, onion, pineapple, garlic, salt, and spices.

Mix all dry ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer with the hook attachment. Add butter, coconut oil, milk and water. Mix at low speed for 5 minutes. Dough should be a ball that can be removed from the bowl. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface. Cut into 10 equal pieces and roll each piece into a ball. Allow balls to sit for 10 minutes. Place a small bowl of softened butter (about 3 tablespoons) and a pastry brush on your work surface. Using a rolling pin, roll each ball flat (about 7 inches diameter and ¼-1/8 inch thick) Rub a thin layer of softened butter over the surface of each piece of dough, using a brush or your fingers. Fold dough in half. Rub a layer of butter over the top surface. Fold again. Place onto a lightly greased jellyroll pan. When all the balls are rolled and buttered and shaped, let them sit for 10 minutes. Bake them in the center of the preheated oven for 15-20 mins, until they are lightly browned. Remove from the oven and brush the rolls with a bit more butter. Serve warm or allow to cool and store in an airtight container for a day or two. (They are best served fresh)Grilled Snapper Sandwich Mix mayonnaise with jerk spice and set aside or store in the fridge for up to 3 days. Preheat grill or a heavy cast iron grill pan.
