Prepare the filling:  Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add onion & bell pepper and sauté 3 to 4 minutes until softened.  Raise heat to high and add beef.  Cook, stirring constantly, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes.   Use a spoon to scoop out some of the liquid; discard.   Stir in cumin, olives, raisins, honey, salt, pepper and hot sauce.  Cook until the meat is golden brown, liquid has evaporated and flavors have blended, about 4 more minutes.  Cool completely in the refrigerator.  Stir in 3 egg whites when mixture is cool.2.  Prepare pastry:  Process butter, cream cheese and cream in a food processor or electric mixer.  Add flour and salt and mix just until combined and dough holds together in a ball.  Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface.  Divide into three pieces.  Flatten into disks and wrap each in plastic wrap.  Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before rolling out.  If the dough is chilled overnight, take it out for about 15 minutes before rolling out.3.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Butter baking sheets or line with parchment.4.  Dust a rolling pin with flour.  Working with one dough disk at a time, place the disk on a clean, well-floured surface (I use a silpat mat).  Roll gently from the center of the dough to the top and bottom edges and from side to side.  Reflour the work surface and/or rolling pin, as needed.  You want the dough to be thin but not transparent.5.  Assemble the empanadas:  Use an overturned bowl (about 4 inches across) to cut out circles.  Gather scraps together, re-roll and cut more circles until you’ve used up all the dough.  Scoop some filling into the center of the dough circle (about 2 Tbsp.).  Wet the edge of the dough with water, using your finger to to rub.  Fold the dough over to form a half-circle.  Crimp edges with a fork, or fold over decoratively (using more water, as needed, to act as ‘glue.’)  Repeat the process until all of the filling is used.  The empanadas can be frozen at this point, or placed onto a baking sheet.  If baking right away, chill the filled empanadas for a few minutes.  Prick the top of each empanada twice with a fork.  Beat 2 egg yolks with 2 Tbsp. water and brush egg wash over each empanada.  Bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown.6.  Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.

350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.                          In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, salt and ginger.                          In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, yogurt, oil, vanilla extract, banana, carrots, and egg. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and fold to blend well. Fill the cups of the muffin tin about halfway with the batter. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the tops of the cupcakes spring back when lightly pressed, 15 to 20 minutes.                          Cool in the pan for 3 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely (cooling the cupcakes in the pan completely will make them tough).                          For the frosting: In the heatproof bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the sugar, salt and egg whites. Place the bowl over a saucepan of gently simmering water to create a double boiler (make sure there is space between the water and the bottom of the bowl). Whisking by hand, heat the mixture until slightly thickened, a bit lighter in color and hot to the touch; a candy thermometer dipped into the mixture should reach 160 degrees F (very important so that the frosting will whip up firmly!). Return the bowl to the stand mixer. Whip the mixture on high speed until very thick, fluffy and pale latte in color, 5 to 10 minutes depending on your mixer. The frosting is done when it's very stiff and the bowl is completely cool to the touch all over.                          Top the cooled cupcakes with 2 tablespoons frosting per cake.

Let sit for a few minutes to soften the gelatin, then heat the mixture over medium-low heat and stir in the agave. Whisk in the cocoa powder, vanilla, and coffee granules. Let the mixture heat until it nearly boils, then remove from the heat and strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a heatproof bowl.Cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes, or until cooled and slightly thickened. It should be the consistency of runny pudding. Don’t chill it too long or it will be too thick to incorporate whipped cream. (Note:If by chance your chocolate mixture gets too thick, use an immersion blender or a regular blender to smooth it out.)While the chocolate mixture is chilling, whip the heavy cream using a stand mixer or handheld mixer on medium high speed until stiff peaks form. Cover and refrigerate until the chocolate mixture has cooled and thickened.Stir one-fourth of the whipped cream right into the chocolate.

Place butter and sugar in the bowl of a standing mixer and beat until light in color. Add the red food coloring, egg and milk and beat to combine. Proceed with recipe and chill for 2 hours.                          Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.                          Sprinkle a work surface and rolling pin with confectioner's sugar and roll out dough to 1/4-inch thick. Move dough frequently to prevent it from sticking and add more confectioner's sugar to the work surface and rolling pin as needed. With a 2 1/2-by-3-inch heart-shaped cookie cutter, cut 36 hearts, re-rolling dough as needed. Place at least 1 inch apart on parchment-lined baking sheets, and bake until cookies are set but not brown, about 7-8 minutes. Let cool on the pan slightly before transferring to a rack to cool completely.                          To make striped Valentine hearts, transfer half of the melted chocolate to a disposable pastry bag, twist the end closed, and using scissors, snip a very small opening in the tip. Starting at the bottom of the cookie, apply gentle pressure to the pastry bag and drizzle lines of chocolate back and forth over the cookie, moving up as the chocolate flows. Allow chocolate to set before eating or packaging.                          To make polka-dot Valentine hearts, color the remaining chocolate with pink food coloring to the desired shade of pink. Transfer to a disposable pastry bag, twist the end closed, and using scissors, snip a very small opening in the tip. Hold the pastry bag perpendicular to the cookie and apply gentle pressure to pipe a dot of chocolate. Release the pressure on the bag until the flow stops, and continue over the surface of the cookie, piping different sized dots, if desired. Gently tap the cookie to settle the chocolate and allow to set before eating or packaging.                          Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. Place butter and sugar in large bowl of electric stand mixer and beat until light in color. Add egg and milk and beat to combine. Put mixer on low speed, gradually add flour, and beat until mixture pulls away from the side of the bowl. Divide the dough in half, wrap in waxed paper, and refrigerate for 2 hours.                          Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.                          Sprinkle surface where you will roll out dough with powdered sugar. Remove 1 wrapped pack of dough from refrigerator at a time, sprinkle rolling pin with powdered sugar, and roll out dough to 1/4-inch thick. Move the dough around and check underneath frequently to make sure it is not sticking. If dough has warmed during rolling, place cold cookie sheet on top for 10 minutes to chill. Cut into desired shape, place at least 1-inch apart on greased baking sheet, parchment, or silicone baking mat, and bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until cookies are just beginning to turn brown around the edges, rotating cookie sheet halfway through baking time. Let sit on baking sheet for 2 minutes after removal from oven and then move to complete cooling on wire rack. Serve as is or ice as desired. Store in airtight container for up to 1 week.

This wine is 100% barrel fermented in French Oak and aged on the yeast lees to impart a rich, toasty, complex character to the wine. \n\nTasting Notes for this Vintage\nConcentrated rich flavors of tropical fruit marry with mineral elements and French oak accents.

Chiffon Cake with Orange Filling and Meringue","readyInMinutes":45,"servings":12,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/543996-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"dishTypes":["side dish"],"diets":[],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"For the orange filling:In a medium saucepan, whisk together sugar, cornstarch and salt. Stir in orange zest, orange juice, and lemon juice. Bring mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently, and allow to boil about 1 minute (mixture should thicken slightly and become translucent). Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk together egg yolks and egg until very well blended. While mixing egg mixture, slowly pour 1/4 cup of the hot orange juice mixture over eggs and stir until well blended. Remove saucepan from heat (once it's boiled as listed above) and while stirring mixture in saucepan, slowly pour egg mixture into saucepan. Reduce burner temperature to medium-low heat and return saucepan to burner and cook, stirring constantly (and whisking rather vigorously to prevent curdling) until mixture thickens well, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat, add butter and stir until combined. Pour into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap pressing directly against surface of filling, and chill 2 hours.For the cake:Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour 3 9-inch round cake pans (lightly butter sides), set aside. To the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or using a bowl and electric hand mixer), add 1 1/3 cups granulated sugar, baking powder, salt and sift cake flour into bowl. Pour in canola oil, egg yolks (while reserving the whites in a separate mixing bowl) and orange juice. Blend mixture on medium-high speed until smooth, about 3 - 4 minutes (slightly less if using a paddle attachment that has the scraper), occasionally scraping down sides and bottom of bowl. Blend in orange zest and vanilla extract.In a large mixing bowl, using an electric hand mixer (or if you have two stand mixer bowls you can use your stand mixer with the whisk attachment), whip 5 reserved egg whites with 1/2 tsp cream of tartar on moderately high speed until stiff (but not dry) peaks form. Add half of the whipped egg whites to the batter and fold until partially combined, then add remaining half of the whipped egg whites and fold just until combined (be careful not to overfold and deflate the eggs).Divide batter evenly among prepared baking pans and bake in preheated oven 17 - 19 minutes until toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean. Allow to cool in cake pans 10 minutes, then invert onto wire racks to cool completely before frosting with meringue.For the meringue:Add 6 egg whites (don't allow one drop of egg yolk) and sugar to a very clean heatproof bowl and set over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Heat mixture, stirring constantly, until it registers 160 degrees on a candy thermometer, about 3 - 5 minutes. Remove bowl from saucepan, add 1/4 tsp cream of tartar and beat mixture with an electric stand mixer on medium-high speed until stiff glossy peaks form, about 7 - 9 minutes (possibly longer in a humid environment).To assemble cake:Trim tops of each cake off to form an even layer. Spread half of the chilled orange filling over 1 layer of the cake (crumb/top side up, drop in a large dollop and spread outward so it doesn't get all crumby), leaving about a 1/2-inch rim of cake uncoated (because once the other layers are added the weight will slightly push the filling outward). Top with another layer of the cake (crumb/top side up), followed by remaining half of the orange filling, leaving a 1/2-inch rim of cake uncoated. Top with last layer (crumb/top side down) and spread meringue over entire cake. Toast meringue with a culinary torch until golden brown (and keeping a close eye making sure to blow any little flame out). Serve immediately or store covered in refrigerator and bring to room temperature before enjoying.Recipe Source: Filling - Cooking Classy, chiffon cake - adapted with slight changes from Southern Living, meringue - adapted from many different sources I've learned how to make meringue from, ratios my own.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the orange filling:In a medium saucepan, whisk together sugar, cornstarch and salt.
