Once oil is hot, crumble beef into oil, add onions and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up beef when stirring, until beef has browned and cooked through. Drain fat from beef and return to skillet (my mom doesn't drain the fat, she says it gives it more flavor so you can leave it if you'd like). Stir in garlic, chili powder, paprika, cumin, kidney beans, canned diced tomatoes and green chilis then season mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer, uncovered for 10-15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, spoon mixture over Navajo Fry bread, then top with lettuce, cheese, tomatoes and sour cream (and any of the other optional toppings listed). Serve immediately.In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, yeast and salt. Whisk melted butter into warm milk and pour milk mixture into dry ingredients. Stir until mixture comes together and forms a ball, dough should be slightly sticky and elastic so add an up to an additional 1/4 cup milk as needed. Cover dough with plastic wrap and allow to rest 10 minutes. Heat 1 inch of oil in a large cast iron skillet to 350 - 360 degrees over stove top. Divide rested dough into 10 equal pieces. Working with floured hands and one piece of dough at a time (keep other pieces covered with plastic wrap), roll dough out on a lightly floured surface into a 5 - 6-inch circle and gently drop into hot oil, and cook until golden brown, then rotate and cook opposite side until golden brown. Remove from oil and drain onto a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels. Serve warm with Navajo Taco topping or for dessert, spread with honey butter.Recipe Source: Cooking Classy","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium high heat.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Turn on broiler in oven to high.Spread out a layer of tortillas on baking sheet.

2 teaspoons oil until tender; remove from the heat. In a small bowl, combine the parsley, green onions, thyme, lemon peel, salt, pepper, cayenne and reserved garlic. Set aside 1/2 cup for crumb topping.                                                                                            Add softened butter to remaining herb mixture; mix well.

Meanwhile, sprinkle steaks with coarse pepper. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook steaks in remaining oil for 4-5 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145°; medium, 160°; well-done, 170°).

cornstarch and salt; whisk to combine fully.Pour ¼ cup of the milk into the dry mixture and whisk to dissolve the cornstarch completely.  Add the remaining milk and lightly beaten egg yolks to the mixture, whisking to fully combine.Heat saucepan over medium heat until the mixture comes almost to a simmer and begins to show bubbles, stirring often using a heatproof spatula.  Reduce heat to low, continuing to stir constantly, scraping the bottom and sides of the pan while stirring, until the pudding thickens (5-10 minutes).Continue to stir the pudding constantly.  When the pudding can be spooned onto the top of the pudding mixture and it holds its form, rather than melting back into the mixture, it should be removed from the heat (approximately 5 additional minutes).Add the butter to the pudding mixture; stir until butter is fully dissolved.Add the pumpkin, nutmeg and vanilla extract to the pudding; whisk briskly to fully combine.Pour pudding mixture through strainer, using the stirring spatula to press the mixture through the strainer, as well as scraping the outside of the strainer into the bowl.Pour pudding into a quart size Mason jar or an alternative container with a sealable top/lid.  Seal and place in the refrigerator until fully set (approximately 1-2 hours).In a chilled mixing bowl (or the bowl of a standing mixer), combine 1 ½ cups heavy whipping cream, 1 tablespoon plus 1 ½ teaspoons and prepared Chai tea.  Note: most varieties of Chai are very sweet.  I recommend stirring the mixture before whipping and tasting it to ensure it is sweet enough for your preference, remembering it will be combined with sweet spice cake and the pudding.  You can add more sugar if the flavor is not sweet enough to your taste before beating.Mix on high to form semi-soft peaks.  In a chilled mixing bowl (or the bowl of a standing mixer), combine 1 cups heavy whipping cream, 1 tablespoon sugar and ½ teaspoon vanilla extract.  Whip to form soft peaks.Divide spice cake into 6 equal portions.  Remove the pudding from the refrigerator and gently stir to soften.In pint size Mason jars (or other equivalent sized serving container) place roughly 1/3 of a spice cake portion in the bottom of the jar.Spoon approximately 2- 2 ½ tablespoons of the pumpkin pudding over the layer of spice cake.  Followed by the same amount of Chai Whipped cream.Add the second layer of spice cake repeating the layering of pumpkin pudding and Chai whipped cream.Top with remaining spice cake, a dollop of the regular whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon.Repeat for remaining 5 trifles.  Serve.  Note: the prepared trifles, without the topping of whipped cream, can be sealed and refrigerated for a few hours before serving.  When ready to serve add the whipped cream topping and cinnamon.  The whipped cream is best prepared just before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Before starting place a fine mesh strainer over a bowl and set aside.In a medium saucepan combine the sugar, cornstarch and salt; whisk to combine fully.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405600,"name":"sieve","image":"strainer.png"},{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"},{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Pour ¼ cup of the milk into the dry mixture and whisk to dissolve the cornstarch completely.","ingredients":[{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"milk.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the remaining milk and lightly beaten egg yolks to the mixture, whisking to fully combine.","ingredients":[{"id":1125,"name":"egg yolk","image":"egg-yolk.jpg"},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"milk.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Heat saucepan over medium heat until the mixture comes almost to a simmer and begins to show bubbles, stirring often using a heatproof spatula.

Heat the olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the garlic and onions and saute until starting to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the ground beef and sausage and cook until browned. Drain off almost all of the fat, leaving a bit behind for flavor and moisture. Add the tomato sauce, tomatoes, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes and some salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes. Remove 3 to 4 cups of the cooked sauce to a bowl to cool down.                          Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add some salt. Cook the ziti until not quite al dente.                          Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.                          In a bowl, mix 2 cups of the grated mozzarella, the ricotta, Parmesan, parsley, eggs and some salt and pepper. Stir together just a couple of times (do not mix completely).                          Drain the pasta and rinse under cool water to stop the cooking and cool it down. Pour it into the bowl with the cheese mixture and toss to slightly combine (there should still be large lumps). Add the cooled reserved meat sauce and toss to combine.                          Add half the coated pasta to a large casserole dish or lasagna dish. Spoon half of the remaining sauce over the top, then top with half the remaining mozzarella.

Reduce heat to low, continuing to stir constantly, scraping the bottom and sides of the pan while stirring, until the pudding thickens (5-10 minutes).Continue to stir the pudding constantly.  When the pudding can be spooned onto the top of the pudding mixture and it holds its form, rather than melting back into the mixture, it should be removed from the heat (approximately 5 additional minutes).Add the butter to the pudding mixture; stir until butter is fully dissolved.Add the pumpkin, nutmeg and vanilla extract to the pudding; whisk briskly to fully combine.Pour pudding mixture through strainer, using the stirring spatula to press the mixture through the strainer, as well as scraping the outside of the strainer into the bowl.Pour pudding into a quart size Mason jar or an alternative container with a sealable top/lid.

I recommend stirring the mixture before whipping and tasting it to ensure it is sweet enough for your preference, remembering it will be combined with sweet spice cake and the pudding.
