Preheat oven to 300°. Line a large roasting pan (with sides that are at least 2'' tall) with a double layer of paper towels. Then place eight wide mouth half-pint mason jars on top of the paper towels. Fill a tea kettle with water and put it on to boil. When the water boils, turn off the heat.Stir the cream and milk together and warm them in the microwave or in a saucepan over medium heat. Set aside.Measure out 1/4 cup of the sugar and set it aside.Put a large heavy-bottomed saucepan (I used a nonstick pan) over medium-high heat and sprinkle in 2 tablespoons of the remaining sugar. As soon as the sugar melts and starts to caramelize, stir it. When the color is uniform, stir in another 2 tablespoons of sugar and continue to stir until it is melted and colored. Continue with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, adding it 2 tablespoons at a time. When all the sugar is deep amber, almost mahogany colored, stand away from the pan so you don't get splattered, and stir in the warm liquid. The mixture will bubble furiously and probably seize up, but don't panic. Just keep stirring patiently and it will smooth out. Pull the pan from the heat.Put the eggs, yolks, and reserved 1/4 cup sugar in a large glass measuring cup or a small bowl and whisk until pale and slightly thickened. Still whisking, drizzle in a little of the warm caramel liquid. This will gently warm the eggs so they won't curdle. Whisking constantly, slowly pour in the remaining liquid. If there is foam at the top of the custard, skim it off with a spoon. If you leave the foam, it will form little craters on top of the baked custards. It's not a crime, but the custards are definitely prettier without the little foam craters. Divide the custard evenly between the mason jars. Pour enough hot water from the tea kettle into the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of the mason jars. Cover the pan snugly with foil, poke two holes in two opposite corners and very carefully and steadily slide the pan into the oven. Bake the custards for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the tops darken a bit and the custards jiggle a little only in the center when tapped or lightly shaken. Very carefully remove the roasting pan from the oven and place it on a cooling rack. Allow the custards to rest in their warm bath for 10 minutes, then peel off the foil and transfer the mason jars from the hot water (careful!!) to the cooling rack. Refrigerate when they reach room temperature. When the custards are cool, cover them tightly with their mason jar lids. Place cream in a small pitcher. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean and then also add the bean. Set aside. Stir sugar, corn syrup, and water in a heavy saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides with a wet pastry brush. It will thicken and turn deeper in color. After about 5 to 6 minutes, it should be deep amber in color. Don't let it get too dark. If it starts to smell a bit burnt, immediately remove pan from heat. Gradually add vanilla cream. The mixture will bubble vigorously. Whisk over medium heat until smooth and thick, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in butter and salt. Strain into a heatproof bowl. Let cool slightly. I prefer to eat the caramel custard pots chilled. Spoon some of the salted caramel sauce over each custard and top with some lightly sweetened whipped cream and crushed cookie wafers. It is best to prepare this dessert the day before you want to eat them. The custards should chill for a few hours or overnight to set properly. Just prepare the custards, caramel sauce, and cookie crumbles the day prior. And make the sweetened whipped cream on the day you want to serve. The pots can be completely assembled a few hours before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Center a rack in the oven. Preheat oven to 300°.

Using the “fraisage” technique, use the heel of your hand to press down and smear the dough onto a clean countertop. Push back together and repeat until smooth and all ingredients are well incorporated—the dough will have a slight shine.Divide the dough equally in half (using scale), pat into a disk, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for a least one hour.Preheat a pizza stone in the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 25 minutes.Remove one disk of cooled dough from refrigerator (you can freeze remaining dough for several weeks and save for a later date). Throughout the process, dust rolling pin, dough, and surface lightly with flour to prevent sticking. Using the rolling pin (starting from the center of dough to the outside), roll out into a rough circle to a little less than 1/4\" thickness. Throughout the process, pick up dough carefully and move around ensuring it does not stick. **If dough cracks, gently press back together with hand and continue to roll.Using the rolling pin, pick up the dough and lay over a 9\" (about 1 inch deep) tart pan, gently guiding it into the sides of the tart (try to avoid stretching the dough), pressing with your fingers. Make sure to press the dough tightly inside the corners and sides to shape the tart shell.Roll your rolling pin over top of pan to get rid of excess pastry. Scraps of dough can be pressed together, frozen, and reused.Cover with plastic wrap and place the tart shell back in the refrigerator, while you assemble the filling.Peel one apple at a time, rubbing the outside of the apple pieces with the lemon half to reduce browning and oxidation. Slice in half, core and slice very thinly--and set aside in a medium-sized bowl, sprinkling on lemon juice as you go. Repeat with remaining apples.

(I should note that the traditional crust for this sort of savory pie is a stiff hard crust, not a flaky crust so the next step is contrary to the usual way to make a pie crust but is needed for the crust to be stiff). Knead the dough on the counter for 5-7 minutes, wrap in plastic and let rest for 30 minutes.Preheat oven to 400 degreesWhile dough is resting, in a large bowl, mix all filling ingredients except fresh cheese and prosciutto. Break fresh cheese apart with your hands and gently work it into mixture without over mixing.  Set mixture aside.Take 2/3 of the dough and roll out to fit your dish or pan, having it cover the bottom and sides, spilling over the top. Lay half the sliced prosciutto on the bottom right over the dough, then cover with the filling. Lay the second half of the prosciutto over the filling.Roll out the other 1/3 portion of the dough and cover the top of the pie, trimming excess. Crimp the edges together tight using a fork to press the two edges together. For the traditional Easter pie, take the excess dough, roll out and cut two dough strips and form a cross on the top of the pie. (Or any other decoration you feel that fits your needs)Make egg wash with the egg and milk and brush all over pie top including the cross and the edges.Make four slits through pie top to let steam escapes. Place in the center of the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Lower heat to 350 and bake for 30 more minutes. Lower heat to 300 and bake for 30 more minutes. If not browned enough, bake for 10 more minutes. Cool to room temperature, chill for six hours and serve cold wedges.  Will last for up to five days refrigerated.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl, mix flour and black pepper together with a fork.","ingredients":[{"id":1002030,"name":"black pepper","image":"pepper.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Cut in shortening and mix to pea sized crumbs.

Line a 24-cup muffin pan with cupcake liners.                          Cream the granulated sugar, butter and oil in a large bowl. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until fluffy. Add the vanilla and blend well. Sift the flour, baking soda and sea salt and gradually add to the sugar mixture, alternating with the milk.                          Whisk the cocoa and water until smooth in a small bowl. Add to the mixture and continue beating until well blended.                          Fill each muffin cup three-quarters full with batter. Bake the cupcakes until baked through the center, about 15 minutes. Remove the cupcakes from the pan and cool on wire racks.                          For the chocolate fudge filling: Melt the butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Whisk the cocoa and water until smooth in a separate bowl. Whisk the cocoa mixture into the butter until blended and smooth. Whisk in the powdered sugar until fluffy. Yield: 2 cups.                          For the buttercream base frosting: Whip the powdered sugar, milk, vanilla and sea salt with a whisk attachment on low until smooth and creamy. Add the butter one slice at a time until well blended. Add the shortening and blend well. Whip on high until the mixture doubles, 10 to 12 minutes. Yield: 8 cups.                          For the salted caramel: Combine 1/4 cup room temperature water and the granulated sugar in a small saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Boil without stirring, until the mixture is approximately 325 degrees F and a deep amber color, 5 to 6 minutes.                          Remove the caramel from the heat and whisk in the cream. The caramel will bubble violently. Once smooth, stir in the butter and fine sea salt. Transfer the caramel to a heat safe container and allow cooling for 15 minutes. Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. Yield: 1 1/2 cups.                          For the salted caramel frosting: Whip 2 1/2 cups buttercream base frosting, the powdered sugar and 1/2 cup salted caramel with a whisk attachment until fluffy. Yield: 3 cups.                          Once the cupcakes are cool, cut out the center of each cupcake and fill with the chocolate fudge filling. Top each cupcake with the salted caramel frosting.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the chocolate cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Add the saffron, shake to combine, and immediately remove from the heat and cool. Grind the fennel and saffron to a fine powder in a mortar and pestle or spice grinder. Add 1 tsp. salt and stir to combine. Sprinkle the spice mixture all over the halibut and rub lightly so it adheres. Let the fish sit at room temperature for about an hour.Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 225F.Measure the thickness of the halibut steaks and add the same depth of oil to a 10-inch straight-sided saut pan. Heat over low heat until the oil reaches 120F, 2 to 3 minutes. Put the halibut steaks in the oil in a single layer and immediately transfer the pan to the oven. Poach until a few small whitish droplets rise to the surface of the steaks and the fish near the bone maintains a trace of transparency, 25 minutes. Transfer the halibut to a wire rack to drain for a few minutes. Remove the skin and bones before serving.

Add the second third of the dry ingredients, followed by the rest of the sour milk, again beating well. Add the rest of the dry ingredients and mix just until there are no more white whisps of flour. Divide the batter evenly between the three cake pans and bake until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minute.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Allow cakes to sit in the pans for 10 minutes before turning them out onto a cooling rack to cool completely.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            To construct the cake: Level each cake with a cake leveler so they are perfectly flat. Set your first layer of cake on a cake board and apply half of the chocolate buttercream to the top, smoothing it around the surface with an offset spatula. Stack the second layer of cake on top and apply the rest of the chocolate buttercream to the top, again smoothing it perfectly with an offset spatula. Top with the third layer of cake and apply a small amount of pressure to the cake to gently compress the layer. Don't press too hard.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Apply half of the vanilla buttercream to the sides of the cake only, creating a crumb coat. Set the cake in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. After the icing has chilled, apply the remaining vanilla buttercream to just the sides of the cake. Use an offset spatula heated under warm water and then wiped dry to smooth the vanilla buttercream to a fine finish.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Set the cake onto a cooling rack that has been placed over a rimmed baking sheet. Carefully pour the warm ganache into the center of the cake, allowing it to run out and cover the top of the cake. Stop pouring once the ganache reaches the edges of the top, and allow some—but not a lot—of the ganache to dribble down the sides. Set the cake in the refrigerator to firm up for 1 hour. This cake will stay fresh for up to three days if well sealed and kept in the refrigerator.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 325°F.

Marinate the chicken: In a medium bowl, stir together the soy sauce, rice wine, and cornstarch until the cornstarch is dissolved. Add the chicken and stir gently to coat. Let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes.                                                                            2. Prepare the sauce: In another bowl, combine the black vinegar, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sesame oil, sugar, cornstarch, and Sichuan pepper. Stir until the sugar and cornstarch are dissolved and set aside.                                                                            3. You may need to turn on your stove's exhaust fan, because stir-frying dried chilies on high heat can get a little smoky. Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat until a bead of water sizzles and evaporates on contact. Add the peanut oil and swirl to coat the base. Add the chilies and stir-fry for about 30 seconds, or until the chilies have just begun to blacken and the oil is slightly fragrant. Add the chicken and stir-fry until no longer pink, 2 to 3 minutes.                                                                            4. Add the scallion whites, garlic, and ginger and stir-fry for about 30 seconds. Pour in the sauce and mix to coat the other ingredients. Stir in the peanuts and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a serving plate, sprinkle the scallion greens on top, and serve.

Butter just the sides of a 9-inch round cake pan.                          For the caramel topping: Stir the sugar and 1/3 cup water in a medium saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Stop stirring, and gently swirl the saucepan occasionally until the mixture is the color of deep amber, 8 to 9 minutes. If needed, brush any sugar crystals off the side of the pan with a wet pastry brush. Remove the saucepan from the heat, and carefully whisk in the butter (take care: the mixture can bubble up considerably). Pour the caramel into the prepared cake pan, tilting the pan to cover most of the bottom (be careful: the pan will be very hot from the caramel). Arrange the bananas in a single, tight layer, then cover any gaps with the remaining slices.                          For the cake: Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk together the milk and sour cream in a small bowl.                          Beat the butter and sugar together with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating after each addition and scraping down the side of the bowl as needed, then beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low, and add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk-sour cream mixture, mixing until just incorporated.                          Pour the batter over the bananas in the cake pan, and spread evenly. Bake the cake until it is golden brown and bounces back when pressed and a toothpick or cake tester comes out clean when inserted in the center, 50 to 60 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the cake to separate it from the pan. Poke the cake all over with a skewer, and brush the cake with the rum. Let cool in the pan on a rack until just cool enough to handle, 20 to 30 minutes. Invert a serving platter over the cake pan and, while holding them together, quickly flip them over so the cake unmolds, banana-side up. Let cool completely. Cut into wedges, and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
