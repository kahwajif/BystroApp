Take care to not let it scorch. When it is mostly melted, with just a few small lumps, stir the chocolate bark until it is completely smooth. Let it sit for a minute or so to cool just slightly. Then drop a sandwich cookie into the chocolate. Using a fork, quickly dunk the cookie to completely cover it with chocolate. Lift the cookie out with the fork and tap the fork handle lightly on the side of the bowl to force excess chocolate down through the fork’s tines. Bring the fork outward, dragging the bottom of the tines along the rim of the bowl, letting any other excess chocolate drip down the inside of the bowl. Place chocolate dipped cookie on the wax paper. Repeat until all cookies are dipped.

In a bowl, make the General Tso sauce: Whisk together the soy sauce, vinegar, honey, garlic chili sauce, chicken broth, just 1 teaspoon of the cornstarch. Set aside.2. In a wok or large sauté pan over high heat, add 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil. Add broccoli to the pan and cover. Steam for 2 minutes or until broccoli has turned bright green and is crunchy-tender (just shy of cooked through.) Remove broccoli from pan, drain and rinse with cool water to stop cooking. Set broccoli aside. Empty water from wok or pan and dry well. Return wok or pan to stove.3. In a medium bowl, add chicken, remaining 2 teaspoons of cornstarch, salt and pepper and stir to coat chicken evenly.4. Heat the wok over high heat. When very hot, add cooking oil and swirl to coat. To get a nice crust on the chicken, you'll cook them in a single layer, giving them plenty of space to brown. Add half the chicken to pan in a single layer. Let cook undisturbed for 1-2 minutes, until the bottom of chicken is browned, flip chicken, cook until other side is browned. The chicken should be halfway cooked through - removed the half-cooked chicken pieces to a plate to set aside. As you take chicken pieces out, continually add in more of the raw chicken to the pan to cook.5. When all the chicken have cooked, turn heat to medium. Let the pan cool a bit before adding the rest of the ingredients (so they don't burn). The pan should still have some cooking oil left from the chicken. To the pan, add the green onions, garlic and ginger . Stir fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Control your heat so that the ingredients don't burn.6. Pour in the General Tso's sauce to pan and bring mixture to a simmer. Return the chicken and broccoli to the pan, toss and cook for 1 minute. The sauce should thicken and the chicken should be cooked through completely. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"In a bowl, make the General Tso sauce","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Whisk together the soy sauce, vinegar, honey, garlic chili sauce, chicken broth, just 1 teaspoon of the cornstarch.

Stir together the cornmeal and one cup of water, then pour into the boiling broth. Stir the mixture and allow it to come back up to a simmer. Turn the heat down to low, place a lid on top, and allow to simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until very thick. Stir occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pot.Mince the garlic and slice the mushrooms. Add the olive oil, mushrooms, garlic, and thyme to a large skillet and saut over medium heat until the mushrooms are limp. Season the mushrooms lightly with salt and pepper.Remove the mushrooms from the skillet (leaving any liquids behind in the skillet) and add the frozen spinach. Saut the spinach until heated through.

For the mango honey glaze: Heat the oil in a large high-sided saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and onions cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the mangoes and cook until soft and juicy, stirring occasionally. Add the wine, orange and pineapple juices, 3 tablespoons honey and the chile de arbol and cook, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes.                          Transfer to a blender and carefully blend until smooth, about 2 minutes. Strain into a bowl, season with salt and pepper and more honey if needed. The mixture should be a thick puree. If too thick, thin with a touch of water. Let cool to room temperature before serving.                          For the chicken: Whisk together the buttermilk, chile powders, coriander, granulated garlic, onion powder, paprika and cinnamon in a large baking dish. Add the chicken and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours, turning a few times.                          Remove the chicken from the marinade and pat dry. Place the chicken on a baking rack set over a baking sheet, return to the refrigerator and let sit, uncovered, for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours.                          Remove the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before grilling. Heat the grill for indirect grilling.                          Brush the chicken on both sides with the oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place on the grill directly over the heat and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes.

over medium heat. Add the leek and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle in the arrowroot powder, carrots, and cauliflower, and stir until the powder is absorbed by the oil. Whisk in the broth and stir until slightly thickened. Stir in the chicken, vinegar, and thyme. Add salt and pepper, to taste. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm while you make the topping.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.To make the topping:Combine the almond flour, baking powder, and salt in a food processor. Pulse to blend. Add the coconut oil in pieces, pulsing until the mixture is crumbly. Add the eggs, honey, and sweet potato and pulse until the mixture resembles a very soft dough. Let it sit for 5 minutes before moving to the next step.Spoon the dough on top of the chicken filling in several mounds. It's not necessary to cover all of the filling, but the mounds should be spread evenly. Bake for about 30-35 minutes or until the biscuits begin to brown and are cooked through. If the tops begin to get dark quickly, place a sheet of aluminum foil over the top while it finishes baking.Remove from the oven (Don't forget to use a hot pad! I've burned myself many times putting pans in the oven and forgetting...) and let it stand for a few minutes before serving.Nat's Notes:1. Arrowroot powder is used as a grain-free thickener. Feel free to use an equal amount of cornstarch if you like or double the amount of all-purpose flour.Not-so-paleo, but gluten-free alternative: Use 1 1/3 cup gluten-free oat flour and 1 cup of almond flour in the biscuit dough.

Mix in 1 cup of the flour, followed by 2 tablespoons of water, and then add the remaining 1 cup flour and another 2 tablespoons of water, mixing well until no dry ingredients remain. Dough should be soft and pliable but not sticky; if necessary, add more water until dough comes together.On a lightly floured surface, turn out half the dough and roll it to an even 1/4-inch thickness.

Add the rice vermicelli and, stirring often, cook them until the strands are soft and white, but still resilient, 3 to 5 minutes. Don't be tempted to undercook them, as they must be fully cooked to absorb the flavors of the dish. Rinse them in a colander under cold water just until they're cool and the water runs clear. Let the noodles drain in the colander for 30 minutes, and then set them aside for up to 2 hours, unrefrigerated.    Cook the shrimp:    In a large skillet, heat the oil over high heat. Add the shallots and garlic, quickly stirring until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the shrimp and lemongrass; stir-fry for about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and sprinkle with the fish sauce, sugar, and a little salt. Stir-fry until the shrimp is cooked and the mushrooms are wilted, another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat.    Assemble the salads:    Divide the lettuce, bean sprouts, cucumber, mint, and basil among four large soup or pasta bowls. Fluff the noodles with your fingers and divide them among the prepared salad bowls. Put the shrimp topping on the noodles and garnish each bowl with the peanuts and cilantro. Pass the nuoc cham at the table; each diner should drizzle about 3 Tbs. over the salad and then toss the salad in the bowl a few times with two forks or chopsticks before eating.

works really well with Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Riesling.

One wine you could try is Bernardus Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir. It has 4.7 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 48 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":465202,"title":"Bernardus Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir","description":"The Santa Lucia Highlands are known as one of the premier Pinot Noir appellations of the world. One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Sauté onions in oil and butter, add wine: Heat oil and butter in the bottom of a large pot (6-qt) on medium heat. Add the onions and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.\nAdd the wine, if using, and turn up the heat, cook, uncovered until the wine reduces by half. (If not using wine, add 1/4 cup of water with the clam juice.)\n\nAdd potatoes, clam juice, spices, then simmer: Add the potatoes, clam juice, bay leaf, thyme, salt and pepper, and Old Bay spice. (The potatoes should be just barely covered with the liquid in the pot. If not, add water so that they are.)\nBring to a simmer, then lower the heat to medium and cook, covered, until the potatoes are almost done, about 10-15 minutes.\n\nHeat cream: In a separate pot, heat the cream until steamy (not boiling).\n\nAdd fish to soup, add hot cream: Add the fish to the pot of potatoes and add the heated cream. Return to the stove. Cook on low heat, uncovered, until the fish is just cooked through, about 10 minutes.\nKeep your eye on the heat! If you are using straight heavy cream you should be more easily able to avoid curdling, even if the soup starts to boil. But if you are substituting light cream, half and half, or milk, the mixture will likely curdle if it gets near boiling point (one of the reasons I like using straight heavy cream).\nKeep the temperature so that it barely gets steamy, but not simmering.\nWhen the fish is just cooked through, remove from heat.\nMix in the parsley. The flavors will improve if the soup rests 30 minutes before serving.\nServe with crusty bread or oyster crackers (not for gluten-free version).","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Sauté onions in oil and butter, add wine","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat oil and butter in the bottom of a large pot (6-qt) on medium heat.","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the onions and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add the wine, if using, and turn up the heat, cook, uncovered until the wine reduces by half.

Depending on your size skillet will determine how much oil is necessary. Bring oil to a sizzle when you drop a couple drops of water into it.Separate biscuits and using a one inch circle cutter (I used a cannoli tube) pop center hole out of each biscuit so it resembles a donut.
