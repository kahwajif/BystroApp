The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.\n\nQuintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

top picks for Salmon. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. You could try Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay.

Prepare brownie layer- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan.  In a microwave-safe bowl, heat chocolates and butter together in small bursts, just until melted.  Stir until smooth.  Sift together flour & baking powder.  In a large bowl, whisk together eggs and sugar.  Whisk in chocolate mixture.  Add the dry ingredients, espresso powder and salt.  Stir until combined.  Spread brownie batter in the prepared pan.  Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes.  Cool completely before continuing with the recipe.2.  Take ice cream out of the freezer and soften for a bit, just until it's easy enough to mash around and spread.  Spread the ice cream over the brownie layer.3.  In a medium bowl, whisk together marshmallow cream and water.  Stir in 3 cups of marshmallows.  Spread the marshmallow mixture over the ice cream.  Sprinkle 2 remaining cups of marshmallows on top.  Freeze until the ice cream is hard, at least 6 hours- but best overnight.4.  Toasting the marshmallows- If you have a handheld blowtorch, run a knife around the inside edge of the springform pan.  Release the latch and remove the ring.  Use a very sharp, wide, thin knife to run under the brownie layer to release it from the pan and transfer it to a serving platter.  Torch the marshmallows until they're golden brown.  If using the broiler, adjust the rack so the ice cream cake will be 2 - 3 inches from the heating element.  Preheat the broiler.  Leave the cake in the pan, put it on a baking pan, and place it under the heating element.  Broil until golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Run a knife around the inside edge of the pan and remove the pan.5.  Serve immediately with a good amount of hot fudge.

They will resist a bit, but keep at it.  As you cut each strip, turn it to coat the cut ends with sugar/cocoa, and as you cut each individual marshmallow, do the same.  All the sides should be well coated and not sticky.

Bake at 350° for 20-25 minutes or until center is almost set. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around the edge of pan to loosen; cool 1 hour longer.                                                                                           Refrigerate overnight. Remove sides of pan. Drizzle caramel topping over cheesecake.                                        Yield: 2 servings.

If your bread is fresh, slice it and place it in the oven as it heats up to dry it out. Or, buy the bread a couple of days ahead of time and allow it to dry out or get stale on your countertop. Once the bread is dry, cut it into small cubes. Also wash and roughly chop the parsley. Add the cubed bread and parsley to the cooked vegetables and bacon. Stir until everything is well mixed.Mix one teaspoon of chicken base with one cup of hot water. Pour this over the bread mixture and stir until everything is well coated. Transfer the stuffing mixture to a large 911 inch glass casserole dish.Unwrap the turkey pieces and rub the skin with olive oil. Sprinkle generously with salt and freshly cracked pepper. Arrange the turkey pieces over the stuffing in the casserole dish. Place the whole dish in the oven and let roast, uncovered, for one and a half hours. The turkey skin should be brown and crispy and the stuffing should be bubbling around the edges. Allow the casserole to rest for about 10 minutes before serving. This will allow the stuffing to soak up some of the moisture and solidify, as well as the turkey juices to redistribute within the meat.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut the bacon into small pieces by cutting across the strips.

375F.Bring the water to boil in a large pot or dutch oven. While it comes to a boil, prep the beans. Fill a large bowl with ice water. Add the salt and beans to the boiling water. Cover and cook 6-9 minutes or until crisp-tender and still bright green. (Be sure to cook the beans to your desired level of doneness; from here on they will re-heat but wont cook further). Drain in a colander. Let dry while finishing.Heat oil (or butter, if using) in a skillet over medium heat. Add the shallots, mushrooms, garlic, salt, and pepper.

one wine will suit every pasta dish. Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti.

Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Cook pasta according to package instructions.

The guacamole should be a little chunky.) Add the chopped onion, cilantro, lime or lemon, salt and pepper and mash some more. Chili peppers vary individually in their hotness. So, start with a half of one chili pepper and add to the guacamole to your desired degree of hotness. Be careful handling the peppers; wash your hands thoroughly after handling and do not touch your eyes or the area near your eyes with your hands for several hours.Chilling tomatoes hurts their flavor, so don't chop the tomatoes or add to the guacamole until ready to serve.Remember that much of this is done to taste because of the variability in the fresh ingredients.

Noir, Riesling, and Sparkling rosé are my top picks for Mexican.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Dice the avocado and put it to marinate in 1 tsp of olive oil, 1 tsp of white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper.

Add sugar, salt, and cinnamon and pulse to incorporate. In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave butter for about 45 seconds or until melted. Pour into cookie crumb mixture and fold until incorporated and crumbs are evenly moistened. Dump into a 9-inch round tart pan (or equivalent, such as six 4-inch mini tart pans) with a removable bottom. Press firmly onto bottom and up the sides (use a tamper or a small flat-bottomed glass to help if necessary). Refrigerate at least 30 minutes or until set. Combine dulce de leche and cream in a microwave-safe bowl. Depending on the consistency of your dulce de leche you can add more or less cream. Less cream will yield a firmer, thicker caramel that stays put, and more cream will make it softer and oozier. I used Trader Joe's brand jarred dulce de leche and found that 3 tablespoons of cream was perfect. If you are using jarred caramel, which is generally thinner than dulce de leche, you probably don't want to use any cream at all. Microwave for 45 to 60 seconds, stirring once, until caramel is smooth and cream is completely incorporated. Spread dulce de leche in an even layer in the bottom of chilled crust. Return to refrigerator to chill while you prepare the chocolate layer. For ganache mousse, place chopped chocolate in a heat-proof bowl. The finer you can chop this chocolate the better. Heat 3/4 cup of cream in a small saucepan until it just begins to bubble (do not let it fully boil). Pour warm cream over chopped chocolate. Let sit for 30 seconds, then begin to gently whisk, making small concentric circles in the center of the bowl, until chocolate is melted and smooth. Add butter, 1 chunk at a time, whisking slowly until incorporated before adding the next chunk. Stir in vanilla. In a clean bowl, vigorously whisk remaining 1/2 cup cream until it forms soft mounds (you're looking for a slightly softer consistency than typical whipped cream). Fold into melted chocolate mixture until smooth and no white streaks remain. Pour chocolate mixture on top of dulce de leche and spread into an even layer. Let sit for 1 to 2 hours at cool room temperature or refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes just until set (if refrigerated longer, the top won't be as glossy.) Lift out of tart pan using removable bottom and slice. Sprinkle with flake sea salt and edible glitter (if desired) just before serving. Tart will keep, covered and refrigerated, for up to 2 days. Let come to room temperature prior to serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To prepare crust, finely chop wafer cookies in a food processor.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"food-processor.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add sugar, salt, and cinnamon and pulse to incorporate.
