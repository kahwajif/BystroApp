Try pairing with Pinot Noir, Riesling, and Sparkling rosé. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Instructions\n\n\n\nBegin the biscuit dough first, so it can rest for one hour.

Beat the butter until creamy, about 2 minutes. 2. Add the brown and white sugar. Mix well, until fluffy. 3. Add the peanut butter and egg and mix well.4. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt in another bowl, then add to the sugar butter mixture. Mix well.5. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.6. When ready to make the cookie cups, remove dough from fridge. 7. Make balls of dough that are about the size of a ping pong ball (about 1.5 inches in diameter).8. Press the balls into discs that are about 2.5 - 3 inches in diameter (they could need to be slightly bigger depending on the size of your cupcake pan).9. Press the dough into a greased cupcake pan. You want the dough to go about halfway up the sides of the cup.10. Refrigerate for about 10 minutes before baking.11. Bake at 375 degrees for about 10-12 minutes. 12. If you want a deeper cup once baked, use a measuring spoon to press down on the cookie a little bit. Allow to cool in the pan for 3-4 minutes before removing so that the cups don't fall apart as you remove them from the pan. 13. Cool cookie cups on a wire rack.14.

Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"1. To make Spicy Peanut Sauce: Purée vinegar, peanut butter, soy sauce, agave nectar, sesame oil, chili oil, and garlic in blender or food processor until smooth.2. To make Soba Noodle Salad: Toss together bell pepper, radishes, and green onions in large bowl. Bring large pot of water to a boil, add snow peas, and cook 2 minutes. Transfer snow peas to bowl of ice water with slotted spoon; drain, and add to vegetables. Return water to a boil.3. Cook soba noodles in same pot of boiling water according to package directions; drain, and rinse under cold water. Drain again, and set aside.4. Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Add tofu, and cook 1 minute per side, or until lightly browned.5. Toss tofu, grapefruit supremes, and soba noodles with vegetables. Divide among 6 bowls, drizzle with Spicy Peanut Sauce, and sprinkle with cilantro and sesame seeds, if desired.How to Supreme a GrapefruitOne challenge in cooking with grapefruit is peeling away the thick pith beneath the skin and the bitter membrane that surrounds the pulp. The solution is a culinary technique called supreming. Here’s how to do it:1. Trim ends all the way to juicy flesh.2. Stand fruit upright, and remove peel and pith with knife, following curve of fruit from top to bottom. (A small, serrated paring knife works best.)3. Holding fruit over a bowl, cut sections along membranes as if you were slicing out a wedge, releasing them one by one.4. Set supremes aside, and squeeze membrane “skeleton” over bowl to release any remaining juice.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make Spicy Peanut Sauce: Purée vinegar, peanut butter, soy sauce, agave nectar, sesame oil, chili oil, and garlic in blender or food processor until smooth.","ingredients":[{"id":19912,"name":"agave","image":"agave.png"},{"id":4058,"name":"sesame oil","image":"sesame-oil.png"},{"id":1014053,"name":"chili oil","image":"chili-oil.jpg"},{"id":2053,"name":"vinegar","image":"vinegar-(white).jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"food-processor.png"},{"id":404726,"name":"blender","image":"blender.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"To make Soba Noodle Salad: Toss together bell pepper, radishes, and green onions in large bowl.

Pulse just a few seconds until combine, it should be very fluffy (if you pulse it too much it will become dense).  Pour crumb mixture into a small bowl and whisk in 1 1/2 Tbsp raw sugar (please do not leave this ingredient out, it's the crowning jewel of these muffins, it's a MUST), set aside.   In a mixing bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt, set aside.

Blanc are great choices for Salmon. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Bubble for 10 mins until reduced by half. Add the clementine slices and simmer for a further 5 mins until the clementines are softened and a little sticky. Remove them from the liquid and transfer to a plate. Bubble the liquid until thickened to a glossy glaze.\nHeat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line a baking tray with foil or baking parchment and place the salmon in the middle  or on an angle to help it fit if you need to. Using a sharp knife, cut the salmon into 8 fillets, cutting through the flesh but not the skin, as this will hold the whole thing together. Cut the thinner end into slighter wider fillets, so everyone gets a similar portion. Brush the salmon with the glaze, making sure you get in between the gaps, and save a little for brushing on at the end. Lay the candied clementine on top, down the centre, and bake for 20 mins.\nWhile the salmon is cooking, make the beetroot crme frache by mixing all the ingredients together in a bowl with plenty of black pepper and a little salt  save a few chives to sprinkle on top. When the salmon is cooked, reheat the remaining glaze, adding a splash of water if it is too thick, and dab it over the top (wash the brush first as it will have come into contact with the raw salmon).

Start the mixer on low, gradually increasing the speed to medium until quite foamy and soft peaks can just begin to form, about 2-3 minutes. Egg white bubbles should be small and uniform.\n\nContinue to beat egg whites, slowly adding a sugar, then vinegar: Increase the speed to medium high and slowly add the sugar, a little (1-2 teaspoons) at a time. Continue to whip egg whites and sugar for a few minutes, then add the vinegar.\n \nIncrease the speed to the highest setting and whip the egg whites until they are glossy and stiff peaks form when the whisk is lifted, about 4 to 5 minutes.\n\nUse a rubber spatula to gently fold in the crushed peppermints (and the mini chocolate chips, if you are using).\n\nPipe meringues onto lined cookie sheet: Line 2 large cookie sheets with parchment paper or silicone. If you are using parchment paper, you can put a dollop of the meringue mixture in the corners of the pans before placing the parchment paper on them, to help secure the parchment paper in place (pastry chef's trick).\n \nEither use a spoon to drop teaspoonfuls of the meringue mixture onto the cookie sheets (spaced an inch apart) or use a pastry piping bag (can make one with a plastic freezer bag with the corner cut off) to pipe mounds (1 1/2 inches wide) onto the lined cookie sheet.\n\nBake 1 minute, turn oven off: Put the cookie sheets in the 300°F oven, close the door. Wait for one minute only, then turn the oven OFF. Do not open the door for another 3 hours. You can leave them in the oven overnight.

Sprinkle each half of squash with 1/4 tsp. salt, then place facedown on prepared baking sheet along with onion quarters.                                                                            Combine turmeric, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. allspice, and 1/8 tsp. cayenne in a large bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat. Arrange chicken skin side up alongside squash and onions on baking sheet. Brush tops of chicken with 1 Tbsp. olive oil. Bake until interior of squash and onions are fork-tender, chicken skin is crispy, and an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chicken registers 165F, 3545 minutes; if chicken is done before squash, remove from oven and let rest until squash is finished cooking.                                                                            Meanwhile, whisk lemon juice, pomegranate molasses, and remaining 3 Tbsp. oil, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. allspice, and 1/8 tsp. cayenne in a large bowl.                                                                            Finely chop onion quarters and transfer to bowl with dressing. Using a fork, scrape squash crosswise to pull strands from shells into bowl with dressing; discard shells. Add pistachios, pomegranate seeds, dill, and mint and toss to coat.                                                                            Divide chicken among plates, top with dill and mint, and serve alongside squash mixture.                                    Cooks' NotePomegranate molasses is available at Middle Eastern grocery stores and specialty food stores. You can substitute 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar and 1 teaspoon of honey for the 1 tablespoon of pomegranate molasses in the dressing.If the squash is difficult to cut, poke it all over with a paring knife and microwave on high for 5 minutes before cutting.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 375F.

Add onions, garlic, and jalapeno and cook 2-3 minutes until onions become translucent and garlic is fragrant. Add cubed squash, cumin and chili powder and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the squash is slightly tender, 8 to 10 minutes. You want the squash to be fork tender, but not so tender that it starts to fall apart and become mush.Next add the black beans, corn tortilla pieces, and can of enchilada sauce and stir to combine. Reduce heat to medium-low and sprinkle in 1/2 cup of cheese. Stir again and simmer for a few minutes until everything is nice and melted. Turn your oven broiler to high. Sprinkle an additional 1/2 cup of cheese over the top of the enchilada mixture and place in the oven under broiler for 3-5 minutes until cheese melts and tortilla edges become a bit golden brown. Remove from heat and serve immediately. Serve with sour cream, cilantro, guacamole, or hot sauce!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a large oven-proof skillet.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add onions, garlic, and jalapeno and cook 2-3 minutes until onions become translucent and garlic is fragrant.","ingredients":[{"id":11979,"name":"jalapeno pepper","image":"jalapeno-pepper.png"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add cubed squash, cumin and chili powder and season with salt and pepper.
