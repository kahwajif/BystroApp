Reduce to a simmer, cover and cook until the meat is almost falling apart, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Transfer the meat to a bowl and shred with a fork; cool. Reserve the broth.                          Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, garlic and shallot; cook until the onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in the scallion, paprika, sazon completa, oregano, cumin and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Add the beef and 1 cup of the reserved broth and cook over medium heat until thick, about 10 minutes. Season with salt.                          Make the dough: Mix 3 1/2 cups hot water, the sugar, vegetable oil, butter and salt in a medium bowl until the butter melts. Stir in the cornmeal and flour until a soft dough forms, then knead on a clean surface until the dough comes together. Shape into 12 balls, using about 1/2 cup dough for each.                          One at a time, sprinkle each dough ball with water, place between two pieces of lightly oiled heavy-duty plastic wrap (a cut resealable bag works well) and roll into a 7-inch circle. Remove the top sheet of plastic and place 2 to 3 tablespoons filling in the center of the dough. Use the bottom piece of                          plastic to fold the dough in half over the filling and press to seal. Trim into a half-moon shape with a knife or press down with the round edge of a bowl. Remove the plastic and place the empanada on a parchment-lined baking sheet.                          Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Heat 1 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet until a deep-fry thermometer registers 365 degrees F. Fry the empanadas in batches until golden, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet; keep warm in the oven.                          Make the sauce: Combine the cilantro, olive oil, avocado, bell pepper, scallion, vinegar and garlic in a blender. Add 1 teaspoon salt and 2 teaspoons pepper and puree until smooth. Thin out the sauce with up to 1/4 cup water and serve with the empanadas.

Set aside.In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.  Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition, then stir in the remaining 1 tsp of vanilla.  With the mixer off, add in the cocoa mixture, then turn the mixer to medium and beat the two mixtures together until they are one uniform color.  Slowly add in the flour and salt and mix on medium-low speed, just until combined.  Do not overmix.Remove the bowl from the mixer and stir up the batter with a rubber spatula once or twice just to ensure all of the flour has incorporated from the sides of the bowl and there isn't anything stuck on the bottom of the bowl.  You'll want one uniformly colored (red) batter.Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 30-40 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center of the brownies.  Allow brownies to completely cool in the pan on a baking rack, about 45-60 minutes.  Frost brownies in the pan, cut into 12 bars, and serve, or remove the entire batch from the pan to a cutting board, cut into 12 bars, frost, and serve.To make the frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream butter until soft and fluffy then beat in the vanilla.  With the mixer on low speed, slowly add in powdered sugar 1/2 cup at a time; allow the sugar to mix in before adding the next 1/2 cup. Once all of the sugar has been added, beat on medium speed for 30 seconds and scrape down the sides of the bowl.  Add in the melted white chocolate and beat on medium speed until incorporated.

The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.\nThis wine has a broad range of food pairings, whether alone with some well chosen cheeses, richer fish preparations or a good old steak on the barbeque.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438099-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":8,"score":0.82,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fdutton-goldfield-dutton-ranch-pinot-noir-2014%2F154141"}]},"instructions":"Preheat your oven to 400 degrees and rub an 8x8 or 9x9 inch pan with olive oilFill a medium pot with water, as well as large pot.

Shells Recipe\n\nUrvashee Patel | Dessarts\nMarch 24, 2018 10:00 am\n\nThese spinach and tofu stuffed shells are healthier alternative to traditional stuffed shells. Its perfect for your next meatless Monday too.\n\nAre you craving some comfort food but know youre going to feel guilty after eating it? Heres a comfort dish that will make you feel good while you eat it and afterwards too. These spinach and tofu stuffed shells will give you all the nutrients your body needs while warming your belly with the perfect cozy meal.\n\nI replaced classic ricotta with a creamy tofu mixture seasoned with salt and a little lemon juice. Then I added a ton of cooked down baby spinach. Im talking one whole container of baby spinach leaves.\n\nIf I wasnt afraid of the complainers at the dinner table, I probably would have used double the amount. Spinach cooks down to almost nothing right? So why not use more I say!\n\nEating spinach is good for your health on so many levels: lots of fiber, Vitamins A, C, K, folic acid and iron. It also has a bunch of plant compounds that benefit eye health, heart health and decrease cancer risk. I toss it into just about everything.\n\nI add fresh leaves to soups, curries and lately Ive been blending it into my refried beans. No one notices the taste and it enriches foods with extra nutrients and antioxidants.\n\nIm not one of those people that think you can replace anything with tofu. However, using it as a replacement in recipes that call for ricotta cheese is definitely an exception. I love all kinds of cheeses but I dont miss ricotta at all when I replace it with tofu.\n\nIve made lasagna with tofu for group of 15 people and I dont think anyone noticed. So, even if you are anti tofu in all other ways, you should really give this one a try. Theres more protein in it so its better for you.\n\nBut enough with the nutrition! What I like best about this meal is that it only takes 30 minutes to prepare. I can store it in the refrigerator and pop it into the oven whenever I want to eat. Its perfect for those days when get home too late to cook anything. \n\nAre you tired of the dinner routine?\n\nStuck in a rut or looking for fun new recipes to try?\n\nOur Facebook Group is growing every day!

Preheat the oven to 400F.\n\nCook the shells according to package directions but leave them al dente. Drain, rinse briefly, and set them aside.\n\nIn a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Turn the heat to low-medium, add the garlic and saute for 1-2 minutes. Add half the spinach and mix to coat it in oil. Once it has wilted down a little, add the rest of the spinach. Mix to coat and cook until wilted.  Set it aside.\n\nDrain the tofu, break it into quarters. Place the quarters and salt in a food processor and blend until smooth. Add the spinach mixture, lemon juice, and basil and pulse until the spinach is chopped up. Salt and pepper the filling to taste.\n\nAdd 1 cup of marinara to the casserole dish and spread it to cover the bottom.\n\nStuff each shell with about 2 tablespoons of the tofu mixture and place them in the dish. Cover the shells with the remaining marinara sauce and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.\n\nCover the casserole dish with foil and bake for about 25 minutes. Uncover and bake for another 5 minutes or until cheese is bubbling.\n\n \n\nPin\n\nShare\n\nEmail\n\nWant more tasty recipes?\n\nSign up for our newsletter to receive recipes deliver to your inbox for\nfree!\n\nNotes\n\nYou may want to cook extra shells in case they break.\n\nI use firm or extra firm tofu so I dont have to worry about pressing it.\n\nYou can also place the filling in a Ziploc bag, snip off a corner and squeeze it into the shells.\n\nPublished:\n\nMarch 24, 2018\n\nAuthor:\n\nUrvashee Patel\n\nCategory:\n\nVegetables\n\nTags:\n\nVegetarian, Vegetables, Tofu, Pasta, Spinach, Dinners, Family Meals and Snacks, Lasagna, Comfort Food\n\nRelated Recipes:\n\nVegetarian Recipes, Vegetable Recipes, Tofu Recipes, Pasta Recipes, Spinach Recipes, Dinner Recipes, Family Meals and Snack Recipes, Lasagna Recipes, Comfort Food Recipes\n\nRecipe Yields:\n\n4 servings\n\nPrep Time:\n\n30 minutes\n\nCook Time:\n\n30 minutes\n\nTotal Time:\n\n1 hours\n\nRelated Post:\n\nSpinach and Tofu Stuffed Shells\n\nPublished:\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nAuthor:\nUrvashee Patel\n\nRecipe Yields:\n4 servings\n\nPrep Time:\n30 minutes\n\nCook Time:\n30 minutes\n\nTotal Time:\n60 minutes\n\nNutrition Facts\n\nServings Per Recipe\n4\n\nAmount Per Serving\n\nCalories from Fat 68\n\nCalories\n416\n\n% Daily Value*\n\n13%\n\nTotal Fat\n9g\n\n10%\n\n  Saturated Fat\n2g\n\n42%\n\nSodium\n1003mg\n\n18%\n\nTotal Carbohydrate\n53g\n\n5%\n\n  Dietary Fiber\n4g\n\n  Sugars\n15g\n\n32%\n\nProtein\n16g\n\n* Percent Daily Value are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

This is just to make sure the ingredients are well mixed and even dispersed throughout.Cut in the butter with your fingertips or a pastry blender. You want to work it to the point where the butter is mostly worked in and the dough looks like a coarse floury meal.Gently stir in the beaten eggs, milk and vanilla extract with a fork until the mixture forms a soft dough.Turn dough out onto a floured surface and give it a little light kneading, until dough comes together in a nice ball. The dough will be a bit sticky. Thats okay.Divide this dough into four equal-sized pieces, gently form each into a small ball, cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.Filling:Add figs, pecans, raisins, dates and walnuts to a food processor. Grind until its a coarse paste.Scrape into a mixing bowl and add the Cointreau, honey, lemon zest, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Mix well with a spatula to combine.Refrigerate until ready to assemble the cookies, at least one hour.Assembling the Cookies:Preheat oven to 350 F.Remove the dough from the fridge one dough ball at a time - keep the others cold as you work with each one because they are much easier to work with cold.Scatter some flour on the surface where youre rolling out the dough. It will help mitigate the stickiness of the dough. With a rolling pin, roll each dough ball into a long thin shape - about 16 x 4 in diameter and about 1/4 thick.Add 1/2 cup of filling down the center of each strip. Use your fingers to work it into a long thin strip of filling. The diameter of the filling should be about an inch or so.Fold one long side over the other and pinch the seams shut on all sides. Turn roll seam-side down and press the dough gently to flatten the seams. This will allow the cookies to bake best and look most attractive once done.Using a floured knife, cut the cookies into 1 1/2\" pieces and arrange about an inch apart on a baking sheet lined with a Bakers Mat or parchment paper. For a standard sized baking sheet, you should be able to fit 18 cookies on the mat per batch.Repeat until done with all the cookies and filling. As you fill up a baking sheet, place it in the oven and bake for 18 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes then glaze and top with colored sprinkles.Finishing the Cookies:While the cookies are cooling, combine the powdered sugar, milk and vanilla in a small bowl. Use a fork to stir until smooth. Set aside until cookies are ready to be iced.Once cookies have cooled for 10 minutes and are ready to ice, use an icing spatula to smear the icing on the top of the cookies then sprinkle with colored nonpareils while icing is still wet. The icing will set rather quickly so only work in batches of 3-4 cookies at a time.Allow cookies to cool completely before storing in an air tight container. They will taste best the day they are made, but they will keep for one week in the fridge. Layer cookies in the container with wax paper or parchment paper for best results.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cookie Dough:In a large mixing bowl lightly stir together the flour, baking powder, sugar and kosher salt with a wire whisk.
