occasionally, about 5 minutes. Remove the almonds to a plate. Increase the heat to high, add the oil to the saucepan and heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the garlic and onions and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Stir in the chicken stock, tomatoes, chipotle puree, the chile powders, cinnamon, allspice and cloves. Bring to a boil and cook for 10 minutes. Next, add the mangoes, raisins, corn tortillas, molasses, honey, maple syrup and almonds. Pour in the warmed chicken stock and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mangoes are soft and the mixture is reduced by half, about 50 minutes. Carefully transfer the mixture to a blender and blend until smooth. Return the mixture to the pan over high heat. Add the chocolate and cook until reduced to a sauce consistency, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Pour the mole into a medium, high-sided saute pan and bring to a simmer. Crack the eggs one a time into a ramekin and carefully slip into the mole. Sprinkle the tops of the eggs with salt and pepper. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook until the whites are just set and the yolks are still jiggly, about 12 minutes. Spoon some of the Creamy Green Rice into a shallow bowl and make an indention in the center. Put the egg in the center and spoon some of the mole over the egg. Sprinkle with the cheeses and garnish with cilantro leaves.                          Place the heavy cream in a small saucepan over high heat and bring to boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until reduced by half. While the cream is reducing, bring 2 3/4 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Stir in the rice and season with salt. Bring to a boil again, stir, place a lid on the pan, reduce the heat to medium and cook until all of the liquid is absorbed, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove the rice from the heat and let sit for 5 minutes with the lid on. Remove the lid and fluff with a fork. Return the rice to the stove over medium heat, add the reduced cream and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the cilantro, green onions and poblanos.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Put the almonds in a medium saucepan over medium heat and cook until lightly golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":12061,"name":"almonds","image":"almonds.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Remove the almonds to a plate.

It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":430626,"title":"NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry","description":"Very aromatic with notes of hazelnut, vanilla, and a touch of oak followed by sweet raisins and a touch of yeast. Clean lasting finish. Good now but will reward those allow it to age\"\". A favorite pre-prandial beverage.

Butter the insides of the ramekins.\n\nMelt butter and brown sugar, pour into bottom of ramekins: Melt 3/4 stick (6 Tbsp) of the butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add brown sugar and whisk until smooth. Pour into the bottoms of the buttered ramekins, dividing the sugar butter sauce evenly among them.\n\nArrange a layer of plum slices at the bottom of each ramekin.\n\nWhisk together dry ingredients for batter: In a separate bowl, vigorously whisk together the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt.\n\nMake cake batter: Use an electric mixer to beat together the remaining 1/2 stick (1/4 cup or 4 Tbsp) butter with the granulated sugar and orange zest.\nAdd the eggs and vanilla, mix to combine.\nAlternately add the dry flour mixture and the buttermilk (or lemon soured milk) mixture to the batter.\n\nBake: Divide the batter among the ramekins. Place the ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet and put in the oven on the middle rack. Bake at 350°F for 35 to 40 minutes, until cakes are firm to the touch, and a toothpick or skewer inserted in the center does not come out with raw batter on it. (Might be wet from plum juice.) Turn the baking sheet around half-way through the baking to ensure an even baking for all the cakes.\n\nCool and invert: Remove from oven and let cool on a rack until no longer hot to the touch. Run a paring knife around the edges of the ramekins. Invert onto a plate and gently lift off of the plate.\nServe alone or with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350°F.

Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Combine the ground chicken, egg, Parmesan cheese, minced garlic, fresh parsley, dried basil, dried oregano, sea salt, and freshly cracked pepper, to taste, and Italian seasoned panko crumbs together in a bowl until just combined.  Roll into mini meatballs and place onto a plate (I filled up two plates full).  Place the meatballs into the refrigerator for 10 minutes so they are easier to work with.   Heat 1 tablespoon of canola oil in a large Dutch oven over medium high heat.  Add the meatballs, in batches, and cook for 4-5 minutes, carefully turning halfway through to cook on the other side, or until golden brown but not cooked all the way through (they will finish cooking in the soup).  Remove the cooked meatballs from the Dutch oven and place on a clean plate.  Finish cooking the remaining meatballs.  Add the remaining tablespoon of canola oil to the same Dutch oven and add the onion, carrots, and celery.  Cook, stirring often, for 4-5 minutes then add the minced garlic.  Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute then add the diced tomatoes and chicken broth, season with sea salt and freshly cracked pepper, to taste.  Cover and cook on low for 30-40 minutes.  Remove the lid and add the pasta and meatballs.  Cover and cook for an additional 15-20 minutes or until the pasta is tender and the meatballs are cooked through.  Add the spinach, stir until combined and slightly wilted, taste and re-season if needed, then ladle into bowls.   Top with Parmesan cheese or feta cheese if desired.

Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Santa Cristina by Antinori Pinot Grigio.

Pat completely dry with paper towels. Keep refrigerated until time to cook. Preheat a large saute pan on medium-high heat. Lightly dust the skin side of the fish with cornstarch and season lightly with sea salt and fresh ground pepper. Add enough oil to the hot pan to coat the bottom. Carefully lay the fish in the pan skin side down. Cook for several minutes, on both sides until skin is crispy and fish is just done. Cooking time will vary. Keep fish skin side up and transfer to a platter.                          Florida Passion Fruit Cream:Place passion fruit, mirin and ginger in heavy medium sized saucepan. Boil until reduced to about 1/4 cup, about 6 minutes. Add wine and boil until reduced to about 1/4 cup, about 6 minutes. Add cream and coconut milk, bring to boil, then reduce heat to medium. Simmer sauce until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes. Stir in curry paste. Season sauce, to taste, with sea salt and fresh ground pepper. Strain through a fine mesh sieve or strainer lined with cheesecloth.                          Florida Citrus and Shaved Fennel Salad:Whisk together vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add oil in a slow stream, whisking, until emulsified. Cut peel, including all white pith, from oranges and grapefruit with a paring knife. Working over a bowl, cut into segments. Squeeze juice from membranes into a small bowl, then whisk 3 tablespoons juice into vinaigrette. Drain citrus segments, then add to vinaigrette. Quarter fennel bulbs lengthwise, then cut into paper-thin slices, about 1/16-inch thick, with a slicer or mandolin. Add to fruit along with fennel and toss gently to combine.                          Sauteed Florida Gulf Shrimp:Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Peel and devein shrimp, leaving tails intact. Pat dry with a paper towel. Add oil to hot pan, and carefully add shrimp and season with salt and pepper. Saute until pink and just done. Place cooked shrimp on plate and serve with Florida Green Mango Jam.;                          Florida Spicy Green Mango Jam:Peel mangoes and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. In a small bowl, toss mangoes with vinegar, sugar, and salt. To make seasoning paste: cut gingerroot into 4 pieces. For a milder chutney, while wearing rubber gloves, remove seeds and veins from jalapeno. Add to a food processor with motor running gingerroot, jalapeno, garlic, cumin, coriander, and turmeric, 1 at a time, and puree to a paste. Heat a 4-quart heavy pot over moderately low heat until hot. Cook seasoning paste, cinnamon stick, and star anise in oil, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes, or until very fragrant. Stir in mango mixture and simmer, covered, over low heat, stirring occasionally, until mangoes are tender, about 30 minutes.

butter, into a stand mixer with the hook attachment.  Mix on medium speed for about 20-25 minutes or until the dough balls up & pulls completely away from the bowl (the bowl comes clean.)  It will look sticky for a while, so be patient with it, you don't want to add a bunch of flour & dry it out.Take the dough out of the bowl & place it on a lightly floured surface.  Shape the dough into a square, cover with a towel & let it rest for 10 minutes.Flatten dough with a rolling pin into about 1/2\" thick square.Spread SOFTENED butter on 2/3 of the square.  Spread a thin layer of raspberry jelly on top of the butter.  Do a tri-fold by folding the non-buttered side over first, then the buttered side on top of that. Place dough on a baking sheet in the freezer for 20 minutes. Once the butter has had time to chill inside the dough, flatten again long ways to about 1/4\" thick.  Then brush melted butter on the center half of the dough.  Fold the bottom fourth of the dough up & the top fourth of the dough down so the two ends meet in the middle (book fold.)  Flatten gently with the rolling pin.  Brush melted butter on the bottom half of the fold & then fold the top half over.  You won't use all the butter.  Save the rest for brushing the hot rolls when they come out of the oven.Use a rolling pin & just flatten the strip of dough to roughly 1\" thick & about 3 inches wide.  Cut 1/2\" to 3/4\" thick pieces.  Take each piece, lay it flat on the table, & roll them from the top down.  Put rolls into sprayed muffin pans.  Cover the pans with plastic wrap that has been lightly greased with pan spray.  Let rise until the rolls are a good 1/2 inch over the top of the muffin pans, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.Bake at 350*F for 13-15 minutes.  Brush the hot rolls with the remaining melted butter hot from the oven.  Allow rolls to cool completely.Make a glaze by whisking 2 cups powdered sugar, 3 Tbsp raspberry jelly/preserves, and 3 to 4 Tbsp of water in a medium sized bowl.  You want the glaze to be pretty thick still, so add the water 1 Tbsp at a time.  Dip the top of the cooled rolls in the glaze, scrape excess icing off using the side of the bowl.  Place rolls on a cooling rack or tray to let the icing dry.  *It's important to let the rolls cool all the way so the icing sticks and doesn't melt completely off.  Once the icing dries, you can cover the rolls with plastic wrap, or stack them in a container to store.  Makes 2 1/2 dozen.*Variations: Use orange marmalade on top of a THIN layer of softened butter in step #4 for an orange or roll.  Complete other steps as written.  Allow rolls to cool.  Combine powdered sugar mixed with a tiny bit of water to create an icing.  The less water you use the thicker the glaze will be.  Flavor the glaze with orange marmalade & dip the tops of the rolls in the glaze; allow glaze to dry.Make Garlicky Butterflake Rolls by sprinkling garlic salt on top of the butter in step #4.  Complete other steps as written.  Brush hot rolls with butter & an extra sprinkle of garlic salt & even grated parmesan cheese if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place all the ingredients for the bread, except the softened butter, raspberry jelly/preserves, and melted butter, into a stand mixer with the hook attachment.","ingredients":[{"id":11419297,"name":"raspberry jelly","image":"raspberry-jam.jpg"},{"id":19297,"name":"preserves","image":"strawberry-jam.png"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404665,"name":"stand mixer","image":"stand-mixer.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix on medium speed for about 20-25 minutes or until the dough balls up & pulls completely away from the bowl (the bowl comes clean.)

Add milk as needed until stuffing is a creamy consistency.Smear stuffing onto the bottom of a cookie. Gently press another cookie on top of the stuffing (bottom side down) to make a sandwich. Repeat with remaining cookies and stuffing.Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Sift together the flour, salt, and baking soda; set aside.Cream together the butter, sugar, peanut butter and brown sugar until fluffy. Beat in egg, vanilla, and milk. Add the flour mixture; mix well. Shape into balls (about 2 tbsp. or so) and place each into an ungreased mini-muffin tin pan.Bake at 375 degrees for about 8 minutes. Remove from oven and immediately press a mini peanut butter cup into each ball. Cool completely in pan, then carefully remove. I like to cool pan completely and then pop the tin into the fridge or the freeze to set peanut butter cups (they will melt). They need to be hardened before popping them out. Then slide a tine knife around the cookies to loosen and pop them out. Enjoy!Must use real butter! Mix all the above together and then press evenly into a 9\"x11\" pan. Bake in 350 degree preheated oven for 20 minutes.Immediately pour chocolate chips over the hot cookies. Allow to melt and then spread over all evenly.Top with almonds and allow to fully cool.

Beat together the sugar and eggs in another medium bowl with an electric mixer until light and foamy, about 2 minutes. While beating, gradually pour in the butter and then the vanilla.                          While mixing slowly, add half the dry ingredients and then all of the milk. Follow with the rest of the dry ingredients, taking care not to over mix the batter.                          Remove 2 cups of the batter and stir in the grape jelly. Evenly fill the liners about two-thirds full, alternating with yellow and grape batter.                          Bake until a tester inserted in the center of the cupcakes comes out clean and the tops spring back lightly to the touch, 20 to 22 minutes. Place the pan on a rack to cool for 10 minutes, and then remove the cupcakes to the rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.                          For the frosting: Beat the butter and salt in a large bowl until fluffy and combined. Gradually beat in the confectioners' sugar until smooth and fluffy. Beat in the milk one tablespoon at a time until the frosting has a nice spreadable consistency. Add the crushed cookies and continue to beat until any large chunks are crushed to smaller bits and the frosting has a speckled, greyish look.                          For the decorations: Arrange the cupcakes in 4 rows on a large serving plate or cutting board. Fit a marshmallow between each cupcake, 5 marshmallows per row, to fill in the gaps between the cupcakes. Spread the frosting over the whole rectangle so it looks like one cake. Sprinkle with the cookie crumbs and black decorating sugar.                          To make the tombstones: Use the black decorating icing and a small round tip to write \"RIP\" or other one-word epitaphs on the top half of the oval sandwich cookies and stick into the cupcakes randomly around the graveyard.                          To make the ghosts: Remove two-thirds of the tube of marzipan and place between 2 sheets of wax paper or parchment. Roll about 1/8-inch thick and cut into 3 rounds using a 4-inch biscuit cutter. You may need to gather and re-roll the scraps for all 3 rounds. Drape over the wrapped lollipops and stick into the cupcakes around the tombstone. Using the black decorating icing and the same round tip, dot eyes and a mouth on the ghosts.                          To make the pumpkins and leaves: Divide the remaining marzipan into 4 small pieces and roll each into a ball. Roll in the orange sugar until coated and place around the graveyard. Use the black icing to pipe a small stem. Fit the tube of green decorating icing with a leaf or ribbon tip to dot bits of green grass poking through the dirt around the graveyard and pumpkins.                          To make a border: Use 6 pieces of the licorice, trimming to fit, to make a border around the cake, leaving the middle of the front side open. Bend the seventh piece into an upside down \"U\" and stick into 2 cupcakes in the front to make an arched gateway.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

to gel up.In a microwave-safe bowl, add the almond milk and sucanat. Microwave at 20-second intervals, stirring between each one, until warm (not hot). Stir in the yeast and set aside for 5 minutes.In a stand mixer bowl with dough hook attachment, add the oil and extracts. Add the flax gel and yeast mixture.Turn the stand mixer on low and add the sorghum flour. Add the oat flour and salt. When all the flour is incorporated, turn the dough out onto a floured surface and lightly knead for ~5 minutes, or until dough can form into a ball and isn't super sticky.Spray a bowl with cooking spray and add the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm spot for 1 hour (it won't rise like regular dough, just get a little bit puffier than before).For the Filling:Roll the dough between two sheets of parchment paper, until 1/4\" thick.In a microwave-safe bowl, add the shortening and applesauce. Microwave at 30-second intervals, stirring between each one, until shortening is melted. Stir in the sucanat and cinnamon. Microwave the mixture for 20 seconds, stir, then spread onto the rolled out dough close to the edges.Roll the dough, then slice into 8.Spray a 6\" cake pan with cooking spray. Add the sliced cinnamon rolls to the pan and cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm spot for 1 hour (it won't rise very much).Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake for ~19 minutes, or until the edges of the rolls spring back when tapped. Let cool in the pan.For the Frosting:In a small bowl, stir together all the ingredients and scoop/pour over the cooled cinnamon rolls. Picture.Version #2: Cinnamon Rolls with a Special Chocolate FrostingFor the Dough:In a small bowl, whisk together the flax and water and set aside to gel up.In a microwave-safe bowl, add the almond milk and date sugar. Microwave at 20-second intervals, stirring between each one, until warm (not hot). Stir in the yeast and set aside for 8 minutes.Measure the oat flour, then add to a small bowl. Whisk in the rice flour, baking powder and salt.In a stand mixer bowl with dough hook attachment, add the oil and extracts. Add the flax gel and yeast mixture.Turn the stand mixer on low and slowly sprinkle in the dry ingredients. When all the flour is incorporated into the dough, the mixture should look a little bit sticky.Take the bowl off the mixer and gently fold in the oat flour one tablespoon at a time (I needed 3 tbs, just enough to make the mixture a little less sticky and scoopable).Spray a bowl with cooking spray and scoop in the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm area for one hour (it won't rise a lot, just a little bit).For the Filling:Put a Silpat on your counter and put a sheet of parchment paper on top. Sprinkle the paper with a tablespoon of oat flour and turn out the dough.Sprinkle another tablespoon of oat flour over the dough and top with another sheet of parchment paper. Roll the dough to 1/4\" thickness.In a small microwave-safe bowl, add the shortening and almond milk. Microwave at 20-second intervals, stirring between each one, until the shortening is melted. Stir in the date sugar and cinnamon (mixture should be spreadable and not too thick).Spread the mixture over the rolled out dough until very close to the edges. Roll the dough and slice into 8.Spray an 8\" cake pan with cooking spray (I used a 6\" cake pan and two silicone cupcake molds) and add the sliced rolls. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm area for one hour.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake for ~19 minutes, or until the rolls are slightly firm when tapped. Let cool slightly in the pan, then transfer onto a wire cooling rack.For the Frosting:In a small bowl, stir together all the ingredients and scoop over the cinnamon rolls.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Version #1: Cinnamon","ingredients":[{"id":2010,"name":"cinnamon","image":"cinnamon.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Rolls with Vanilla Bean Frosting","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"For the Dough:In a small bowl, whisk together the flax and water and set aside to gel up.In a microwave-safe bowl, add the almond milk and sucanat.

While oven is heating, slice stem ends off the eggplants, then peel them halfway in stripes down the side so strips of skin remain intact around the eggplant, with half of the skin peeled away. This helps the eggplant cubes to hold their shape without being too tough (too much skin can negatively affect the texture).Slice the eggplant into 1 - 1 1/2 inch chunks and toss them in a bowl with 1 tbsp olive oil. Spray a full-sized baking sheet liberally with nonstick cooking spray, then spread the eggplant out in a single layer on the sheet.Line a half baking sheet with foil and place the bell peppers and jalapeo or fresno chili pepper on the sheet.Place both baking sheets in the oven and let the vegetables roast for 10 minutes.After 10 minutes, turn the peppers over with tongs and continue roasting for another 3-5 minutes, until the small pepper is soft and collapsing. Remove the small roasted pepper and set it aside. Turn the bell peppers again and return them to the oven. Stir the eggplant.Continue roasting the eggplant and bell peppers for another 10 minutes or so until eggplant is tender and lightly browned and the bell peppers are soft and collapsing. While the rest of the vegetables finish roasting, stem the small pepper, peel off any loose skin, and take out the seeds (unless you want a really spicy matbucha-- I leave 10-15 seeds in for a little kick). Dice into small pieces. You may want to wear gloves during this process to protect sensitive skin from the capsaicin of the pepper. When the eggplant and peppers finish roasting, remove them from the oven. Place the peppers in a bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap or foil and allow to steam for a few minutes. Set the eggplant aside. Once the peppers have steamed, seed them and peel the skin off. Dice into small pieces.Combine peppers, tomatoes, garlic, salt, tomato paste, and chili flakes in a 6 quart pot. Bring ingredients to a boil, then simmer for 30-40 minutes, stirring every 8-10 minutes, until the mixture has cooked down and most of the excess liquid has evaporated.Stir in the roasted eggplant chunks. Continue to simmer for 5-10 minutes longer until thick and saucy. Remove from heat. Stir in sugar or your favorite sweetener to taste. I usually end up adding about 2 tbsp of sugar; it's supposed to be a sweet salad with a bit of a spicy kick. You can add more hot pepper flakes or salt to taste too, if you like.Stir together remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, paprika and smoked paprika in a small bowl.

Snickerdoodles will keep in an airtight container, at room temperature for 3 days, but they are best eaten the day they’re made.","ingredients":[{"id":10219335,"name":"cinnamon sugar","image":"cinnamon-sugar.png"},{"id":18372,"name":"baking soda","image":"white-powder.jpg"},{"id":20027,"name":"corn starch","image":"white-powder.jpg"},{"id":9003,"name":"apple","image":"apple.jpg"},{"id":2025,"name":"nutmeg","image":"ground-nutmeg.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"egg.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","image":"baking-sheet.jpg"},{"id":404695,"name":"kitchen timer","image":"kitchen-timer.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}],"length":{"number":17,"unit":"minutes"}}]}]},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":6,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"preparationMinutes":10,"cookingMinutes":40,"sourceUrl":"http://www.busybuthealthy.com/2013/11/10/peanut-butter-bread/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/peanut-butter-bread-558576","aggregateLikes":290,"spoonacularScore":77,"healthScore":13,"creditsText":"Busy But Healthy","sourceName":"Busy But Healthy","pricePerServing":25.45,"extendedIngredients":[{"id":18371,"aisle":"Baking","image":"white-powder.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"baking powder","original":"1 Tbsp baking powder","originalString":"1 Tbsp baking powder","originalName":"baking powder","amount":1,"unit":"Tbsp","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsp"},"metric":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsp"}}},{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"egg.png","consitency":"solid","name":"egg","original":"1 egg","originalString":"1 egg","originalName":"egg","amount":1,"unit":"","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""},"metric":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""}}},{"id":1124,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"egg-white.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"egg whites","original":"2 egg whites (1/4 cup egg substitute)","originalString":"2 egg whites (1/4 cup egg substitute)","originalName":"egg whites (1/4 cup egg substitute)","amount":2,"unit":"","meta":["()"],"metaInformation":["()"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":2,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""},"metric":{"amount":2,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""}}},{"id":1077,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"milk.png","consitency":"liquid","name":"milk","original":"1 cup milk (I used unsweetened almond milk)","originalString":"1 cup milk (I used unsweetened almond milk)","originalName":"milk (I used unsweetened almond milk)","amount":1,"unit":"cup","meta":["unsweetened","(I used almond milk)"],"metaInformation":["unsweetened","(I used almond milk)"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"cup","unitLong":"cup"},"metric":{"amount":236.588,"unitShort":"ml","unitLong":"milliliters"}}},{"id":20132,"aisle":"Gluten Free;Health Foods","image":"brown-flour.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"oat flour","original":"1¾ cups oat flour (or flour)","originalString":"1¾ cups oat flour (or flour)","originalName":"oat flour (or flour)","amount":1.75,"unit":"cups","meta":["(or flour)"],"metaInformation":["(or flour)"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1.75,"unitShort":"cups","unitLong":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":414.029,"unitShort":"ml","unitLong":"milliliters"}}},{"id":16098,"aisle":"Nut butters, Jams, and Honey","image":"peanut-butter.png","consitency":"solid","name":"peanut butter","original":"1 cup natural peanut butter (use one with no sugar added.

Continue to add the remaining flour,  cup at a time, until the dough starts to come together. It should be soft, but not so sticky that you won't be able to handle it.

Turn into a large oiled bowl and let rise, covered with plastic wrap, until doubled in size, about 2 hours.On a floured surface, roll out the dough until it is about -inch thick. Using a 2-3-inch round cookie cutter, cut out the doughnuts. You can re-roll the scraps to cut more, or roll them into balls to make doughnut holes.

Pour the egg mixture back into the pot with the remaining milk, whisking constantly. Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it comes to a boil and thickens. Remove from the heat. Stir in the butter and maple syrup, then let cool.When the doughnuts are ready to be filled, cut a small hole in one side.

Set aside.In a medium saucepan combine sour cream, 1/3 cup sugar, butter and salt. Cook over low heat stirring until the butter melts. Remove from heat and cool to 100-110 degrees.In a small bowl, whisk together the yeast, warm water and the 1 tablespoon sugar. Set aside for 5 minutes until bubbly.Whisk together the flour, nutmeg, cinnamon and lemon zest.In a stand mixer, beat the mixture in the saucepan with the yeast mixture, eggs and 2 cups of the flour until smooth. Continue to slowly add just enough of the remaining flour a little at a time until a soft dough forms, you may not need it all.On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. After kneading, place the dough into the greased bowl, turning to lightly coat.Cover and set in a draft-free warm place to rise until doubled in size, about 1 - 1 1/2 hours.Make the fillings:In a small bowl, combine the sugar, cinnamon and butter until crumbly.
