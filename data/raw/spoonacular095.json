You do not want to puree them or chop them too small, as the goal is to maintain some of their firm cranberry texture. At this point, place a small plate in the freezer so you can test the jam for proper thickness later.Add chopped cranberries to a deep, heavy-bottom pot and toss them with ¼ cup of sugar. Allow to sit for 1 hour. Stir in strawberries and let sit for another 15 minutes. Make sure your jars are sterilized and ready to go, and start a very large pot of water to boil on the stove for processing your filled jars. Keep the pot of water covered tightly.Mash the fruit slightly with a potato masher to break up the strawberries a bit. Add remaining ingredients to the pot with the fruit, stirring well to combine. Cook over medium heat until the fruit begins to bubble and spit furiously. (This is why you want to use a deep pot!) Skim off any foam that forms with a skimmer. Cook for about 20 minutes, stirring frequently to keep the jam from burning to the bottom of the pot.After 20 minutes, begin testing the jam. Spread a ½ teaspoon of cooked jam on the cold plate and set it back in the freezer. Wait 30 seconds, then run your finger through the jam. Is it thick enough to maintain the path made by your finger, or does it run all over the plate? If you’d like thicker jam, cook for another 4 minutes and test again. Repeat until the jam is as thick as you’d like, but don’t cook too long or you’ll drastically alter the taste of your jam.Working quickly, ladle jam into sterilized 8-ounce canning jars, leaving ¼ inch of head space. Carefully wipe the rims of the jars to remove any clinging jam before you screw on the tops and rings – only screw them to finger-tight or you will hinder the vacuum process that seals the jars. Process in the large pot of boiling water for 10 minutes to guarantee sterilization and to ensure a good seal.Fold a large towel in half and lay it on the counter. Carefully remove jars from hot water using a jar lifter and set them on the towel. Allow the jars to sit undisturbed until they’ve reached room temperature, ideally overnight. Make sure not to jostle or bump the jars while they are warm, lest you break the seal. After a while, you’ll notice a very satisfying “ping” sound coming from the jars as the vacuum sets and the indentation on the lid pops inwards. If any jars have not sealed once they are completely cool – signified by the indentation in the lid not having popped down – store those jars in the refrigerator and eat within 2-3 weeks.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a blender or food processor, pulse the cranberries until they are coarsely chopped.

Cook's Note: Duff points out it doesn't look too bad, but when it's cold, it's going to feel like \"blood and guts and snot and spit everywhere!\"                          Peel the grapes and put them in a bowl. Pour in enough olive oil to coat the grapes and toss. Yuck!                          Cook's Note: Tips for peeling a grape: Grapes have a \"natural hole.\" Start at the hole and peel off 1 side. Go all the way around and try to remove the peel in 4 pieces. If you're lucky, you can get it in 3 pieces. The reason to peel the grapes is to make the texture smooth and blemishless. This will make them feel more gross when they're covered in oil. With the skin off, grapes feel just like the surface of your eyeball.                          Drain the water from the tofu and put it into a bowl. Squeeze the tofu between your fingers to get it all mushy. Pour a little olive oil on top \"for that extra ick effect.\" Crack 2 eggs on top of the icky tofu mess. Squeeze your fingers through it to mix the eggs and tofu together.                          Now it should totally gross people out!                          Cut the pumpkin seeds in half (Duff doesn't say which way, but he does say this is dangerous). MAKE SURE MOM OR DAD CUTS THE PUMPKIN SEEDS! THIS IS NOT A STEP FOR KIDS. Make a small slit at 1 end of each of the Vienna sausages. Stick a pumpkin seed into each slit so that it will feel like a fingernail.                          Arrange the severed fingers in a bowl. Spoon some slimy, gooey piping gel over the fingers. Pour on a healthy dash of olive oil. Very gently, use your fingers to coat the sausages in the oil and the gel so it feels like they're floating in \"gooey, congealed blood.\"                          This recipe was provided by professional chefs and has been scaled down from a bulk recipe provided by a restaurant.

thoroughly. Add olive oil to warm water and pour over dry ingredients. Add sliced olives. Using a wooden spoon, stir until all dry flour is incorporated, 2-3 minutes. Cover mixing bowl with plastic wrap and let it stand for 4-5 hours, until dough is approximately doubled in size.REWORK AND SECOND RISE: Dough will be wet and bubbly. Using a rubber spatula, scrape the dough onto a generously-floured work surface. Let dough sit for about 5 minutes. Dust the surface of the dough with a sprinkling of flour (about a tablespoon). Fold the dough over and press it with the heel of your hand and flip it over and fold it again. Do this several times, allowing dough to absorbs some of the fresh flour, for 2-3 minutes until it firms up a bit and the outside loses most of its stickiness. (unlike traditional bread recipes, there is no need to deflate the dough or remove bubbles in this step) Rinse and dry the bowl. Lightly coat the bowl with olive oil. Return dough to bowl and roll it around to coat it with oil from the sides of the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Let sit for 1½ -2 hours, until it is about 50% larger.REWORK AND FINAL RISE: Again put dough on a floured surface. Flip and knead about 8-10 times, and form a ball. Put ball into a floured Banneton or colander with floured dish towel. (The final rise container imprints it's design onto the bread. If you use a banneton, the bread will have beautiful ridges) Fit the banneton or colander back into the large bowl and cover with plastic wrap. (If it doesn't fit into the glass bowl just cover it with a slightly damp dish towel) Let sit for about 1 - 1½ hours.BAKE THE BREAD: About a half hour before dough is ready, place Dutch Oven with lid on into the middle of the oven and preheat to 500ºF. When the bread is ready, carefully take the heated Dutch Oven out and uncover. Sprinkle cornmeal over the bottom of the pot. Flip the dough into center of the Dutch Oven, being careful to avoid contact with the sides of the pot to get the ideal shape. (If the dough touches the side of the pot, you will need to use a spatula to position it in the center of the pot. It will taste just as good.) Cover Dutch oven, place into oven and reduce temperature to 450ºF. Bake for 25 minutes. Remove lid. Bake for an additional 20-30 minutes until the crust is nicely browned. Remove pot from oven. Transfer bread to cooling rack and let stand for 20 minutes before slicing. Slice into dipping-sized pieces. For dipping, pour some olive oil onto a small plate. Pour some balsamic on top. Whisk a bit to combine.

Remove from heat and let cool until lukewarm (about 100°F).In the bowl of an electric mixer, use a spatula to mix together the water, yeast, sugar, egg, and egg yolks until well combined. Add in the salt, warm milk mixture, vanilla, and half of the flour and stir with the spatula until combined. Fit the mixer with the dough hook, add the remaining flour, and knead at medium speed until the dough is smooth and doesn’t stick to the sides of the bowl, about 10 minutes. Lightly grease a large bowl. Shape the dough into a round and place in the greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.For the icing:While the dough rises, place the cream cheese, corn syrup, cream, sugar, vanilla, and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on low speed until combined. Increase speed to high and beat until the icing is smooth with no lumps, about 2 minutes. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until ready to use. Make ahead: icing can be made up to 5 days ahead of time and kept in an airtight container in the fridge.To shape and fill the dough:Once risen, press down the dough and turn out onto a lightly floured work surface. Use a rolling pin to shape into a 16x2-inch rectangle, long side facing you. Brush all over with melted butter.Combine all the brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl. Sprinkle evenly over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border at the far edge. Roll the dough up, pinching with your fingers to keep it tightly rolled. Arrange on the work surface so the seam side is down. Lightly flour the roll. Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish or two 9-inch cake pans. Cut the roll into 12 equal pieces using a sharp knife (see video for how to do this). Place the rolls cut side up in the prepared baking dish(s). Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm place until doubled, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Make ahead: place the shaped but unrisen rolls in the prepared baking dishes, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Remove from fridge at least one hour before baking and place in a warm spot to let the dough come to room temperature and get puffy. Bake as directed. You can also FREEZE the covered unrisen shaped rolls for up to 3 months. Thaw them to room temperature either overnight in the fridge or for several hours on the counter then allow the rolls to double in size before baking as directed.Preheat the oven to 350°F. Bake the rolls until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Make ahead: At this point you can allow the rolls to cool to room temperature then store, covered, in the freezer until ready to eat. Thaw them overnight in the refrigerator then reheat in a 350°F oven for about 10 minutes, or until hot.Use a spatula to spread the icing all over. Serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the dough:In a small saucepan, heat the milk and butter until the butter melts.","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"milk.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Remove from heat and let cool until lukewarm (about 100°F).In the bowl of an electric mixer, use a spatula to mix together the water, yeast, sugar, egg, and egg yolks until well combined.","ingredients":[{"id":1125,"name":"egg yolk","image":"egg-yolk.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"yeast-granules.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404628,"name":"hand mixer","image":"hand-mixer.png"},{"id":404642,"name":"spatula","image":"spatula-or-turner.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add in the salt, warm milk mixture, vanilla, and half of the flour and stir with the spatula until combined.

For the pastry: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and 1/3 cup of the flour until fluffy. Between two sheets of waxed paper, roll the butter mixture into a 6-by-12-inch rectangle. Place the sheet of butter in the refrigerator or freezer to chill thoroughly.                          In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the yeast and 1 1/2 cups of the flour. In a saucepan, heat the milk, sugar and salt over medium heat to 115 to 120 degrees F (just slightly warm). Add it to the flour-yeast mixture. Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix on low speed, scraping the sides constantly, until just combined. Raise the speed to high and beat for 3 minutes. By hand, stir in the remaining 2 cups flour a bit at a time until it forms a medium-soft dough. Place the dough on a floured surface and knead until it feels elastic, about 5 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest 10 minutes.                          Roll out the dough on a floured surface to a 14-inch square. Remove the wax paper from the chilled pad of butter and place the pad on one half of the dough, leaving a 1-inch margin around the sides. Fold the dough over and seal the butter in by pressing the edges of dough together firmly. Roll the rectangle out to a 20-by-12-inch rectangle. Fold it in thirds like you would a business letter. Again roll the rectangle out to a 20-by-12-inch rectangle. Repeat the folding and rolling out twice more, chilling the dough if the butter becomes too soft. Chill the dough for 30 minutes.                          Lightly roll out the dough on a floured surface and cut into 4-inch squares. Place them on an ungreased sheet tray and let them rise for 45 minutes.                          For the filling: While the dough squares are rising, make the filling. In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the goat cheese, cream cheese and sugar until well mixed. Add the salt and egg yolk and mix on high, scraping down the sides once or twice along the way. Set aside in the refrigerator.                          Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.                          Slice the pears, skin and all, into thin 1/4-inch slices. Cut these into 1/2-to-1-inch strips. Place in a nonstick skillet over medium heat and add the brandy, honey, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves and saute until the pears are soft and the sauce around them thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.                          For the egg wash: Whisk together the egg and milk. Set aside.                          To assemble the Danish: Take about a tablespoon of the cheese filling and place it in the middle of each square, elongating the dollop slightly from one corner to the opposite (do NOT get too close to the edges, the filling spreads as it cooks!). Place a few slices of pear on top of each cheese scoop. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the margin of exposed dough around the filling with the egg wash. Gently bring the opposite corners (not the ones that the filling is stretching towards) to the middle and seal with a pinch. Once all of the pastries are sealed, give the tops a quick brush of egg wash. Bake until golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Serve warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"For the pastry: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and 1/3 cup of the flour until fluffy.

Sparkling rosé are my top picks for Mexican. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. You could try Bernardus Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"In blender, combine all ingredients and blend just until smooth.
