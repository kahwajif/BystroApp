Bring the water or stock to the boil in a large saucepan over a high flame. Add the chicken and return the liquid to the boil, skimming the surface, as necessary. Crush half the ginger and 1 scallion with the flat side of a cleaver or a heavy object, then add to the pan with the chicken. Reduce the heat and poach the chicken for 10 minutes. Remove the chicken from the cooking liquid and allow it to cool; reserve the cooking liquid. The chicken should be about almost but not completely cooked.2. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the bones and cut it into bite-size strips along the grain of the meat. (The bones and scrappy pieces of meat can be returned to the cooking liquid and made into stock. And I never discard the skin.)3. Cut the fresh chile in half lengthwise and discard the seeds and pithy part, then cut into very fine slivers about 1 1/2 inches long. Peel the remaining ginger and cut it into slices and then slivers similar to the chile. Cut the green parts of the remaining 2 scallions into slivers of a similar length; set aside.4. Heat the wok over a high flame until smoke rises, then add the lard or peanut oil and swirl around. When the oil is warming up but before it’s smoking hot, add the fresh chile and ginger along with the dried chiles and Sichuan pepper, if using, and stir-fry until fragrant, taking care that the seasonings do not take color or burn.5. Add the chicken and continue to stir-fry. Carefully splash the Shaoxing wine around the chicken. Add the vinegar, Sichuan pepper oil, if using, and salt to taste. Add up to 1 cup chicken poaching liquid (if the chicken is very juicy, no additional liquid will be necessary), bring to a boil, and then turn the heat down a little and simmer briefly to allow the flavors to penetrate the chicken, occasionally spooning the liquid over the chicken.6. Add the potato flour mixture to the liquid and stir as the sauce thickens. Throw in the scallion greens and stir a few times. Remove from the heat and stir in the sesame oil.

Make the Soup: Combine all of the ingredients in a non-reactive pot, season with salt, to taste, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer until the celeriac is tender.                          Strain the soup, reserving the celeriac and liquid separately. Working in small batches, puree the celeriac with enough liquid to let the blender blades spin, and transfer to a bowl. Whisk enough liquid into the puree to reach a soup-like consistency. Strain the soup through a fine-mesh sieve. . (The soup can be made up to 3 days in advance and refrigerated, covered.)                          To make the Glazed Celeriac: Combine all the ingredients in a large skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the water has evaporated and the celeriac is glazed. Set aside.                          To make the Curried Apple and Celery: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Combine the honey, butter, curry powder, and salt in a medium oven-proof skillet and cook, until fragrant and bubbling, stirring occasionally over medium heat. Add the apples and baste them with the curry mixture, using a kitchen spoon. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake, basting every 15 minutes, until the apples are tender and glazed, about 1 hour. Let the apples and cool. Core the apples and cut into slices about 1/16 inch thick. Set aside. (The apples can be made up a day in advance and refrigerated, covered.)                          Meanwhile, bring a small saucepan of salted water to a boil. Using a peeler, peel the celery, removing the strings. Thinly slice the celery on the diagonal, add to the water, and cook until crisp-tender, about 30 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the celery to a bowl of ice-water, to stop the cooking. Drain and set aside.                          When ready to serve, arrange the glazed celeriac, curried apple, and celery in the bottom of 8 soup plates. Meanwhile, bring the soup to a boil in a teapot.

Elegance and subtlety, which to a large extent come from a blend with approximately 70% of the most prestigious varietal for making rose cavas: Pinot Noir. Delicate cherry color with strawberry tones. Fine and persistent bubbles. Aromas of red fruit, strawberries, cherries and woodland fruits with hints of green apple. Elegant and light on the palate. Well balanced between acid and sweetness with a refreshing finish.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/451641-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.82,"ratingCount":5,"score":0.7575,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fcodorniu-anna-de-codorniu-cava-brut-rose%2F109416"}]},"instructions":"Roast the poblano chiles: Roast the poblano chiles over a gas burner or under a broiler, until blackened almost all over. Place chiles in a paper bag, close the bag, and let the chiles steam in their own heat for a few minutes.\nRemove the chiles from the bag, remove the charred skin, the stem and the seeds. (For a step-by-step, see How to roast chile peppers over a gas flame.)\n\nBroil the tomatillos: Remove the papery husks from the tomatillos. Rinse the tomatillos with water (they may be a little sticky).\nSlice the tomatillos in half and place cut-side-down on a roasting pan lined with aluminum foil. Toss the garlic cloves (peel on) in with the tomatillos.\nCook under a broiler until lightly browned, about 5-7 minutes. Let cool to the touch, then remove the garlic cloves from their skins.\n\nMake the salsa verde: Place tomatillos, garlic, jalapeño, poblanos, cilantro, salt, lime juice, and sugar in a blender. Start on a low speed and then increase the blender speed and purée until smooth. Set aside (can make a day ahead and refrigerate until needed).\n\nPrepare the turkey thigh meat: Cut the turkey thigh meat into 1 to 1 1/2 inch chunks, cutting away and discarding any tough gristly bits or big pieces of fat. Pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.\n\nBrown the turkey: Heat olive oil in a large (6 to 8 qt) Dutch oven or high-sided sauté pan on medium high or high heat (hot enough to sear the meat).\nWorking in batches so as not to crowd the pan (a crowded pan will make it harder for the meat to brown), sear the chunks of turkey on all sides (do not stir the meat in the pan until they have browned well). Remove with a slotted spoon to a bowl.\n\nSauté onions, add garlic: Add the chopped onion and the cumin to the pot, and cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan, until the onions are translucent (about 5 minutes).\nAdd the garlic, cook for 30 seconds more.\n\nAdd turkey, tomatillo sauce, stock, spices to pot: Return the turkey to the pot. Add the tomatillo sauce and the chicken stock.\nAdd the chipotle powder, oregano, bay leaves, and ground clove. Add a teaspoon of salt, and a little freshly ground black pepper.\n\nSimmer 3 to 4 hours: Bring to a simmer, and reduce heat to low (enough to maintain a low simmer), while the pot stays uncovered. Cook for 3 to 4 hours, uncovered, until the turkey is tender.\nIf at some point you think that too much liquid is going to evaporate, cover the pan. Otherwise keep it uncovered. You want the sauce to become more concentrated. Adjust seasonings to taste. You may need to add more salt than you would expect.\nServe in a bowl, with chopped fresh cilantro, and sides such as chopped avocado, thinly sliced lettuce that has been seasoned with vinegar and salt, sliced radishes, thinned sour cream or crema fresca, and with fresh heated tortillas or tortilla chips. Or serve with rice and beans, or wrapped up in a large flour tortilla, burrito style.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Roast the poblano chiles: Roast the poblano chiles over a gas burner or under a broiler, until blackened almost all over.","ingredients":[{"id":10011333,"name":"poblano pepper","image":"poblano-peppers.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405914,"name":"broiler","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place chiles in a paper bag, close the bag, and let the chiles steam in their own heat for a few minutes.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Remove the chiles from the bag, remove the charred skin, the stem and the seeds.

Preheat oven to 360°. (Yes, that temperature is correct.)2. Sift flour, salt, and baking powder together in a small bowl. Set aside.3. Put milk and butter together in a sauce pan over low heat. Cook until it reaches the boiling point. The mixture should be very hot and just starting to boil, but don’t allow it to overcook. Remove from heat.4. Put sugar in the mixing bowl. Add eggs one at a time, beating thoroughly after each. Add vanilla and mix thoroughly. Add flour mixture gradually, mixing well.5. Add the hot milk and butter mixture to the flour and eggs mixture all at once. Mix well.6. Pour into prepared cake pans and bake for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to sit about 10 to 15 minutes in the pan. The cake tends to crisp around the edges and stick to the pan, so run a knife around the edges to loosen the cakes while they are still warm. Remove from pans, peel off the wax paper, and cool on a rack overnight.DAY 2: THE FROSTING AND ASSEMBLY1. Mix together sugar, cream of tartar, and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil without stirring, until the mixture spins a 6-inch thread (about 240° to 242°). Keep the pan covered for the first 3 minutes of cooking to prevent crystals from forming on the sides of the pan.2. Beat two egg whites in a large glass mixing bowl until stiff. Pour the hot syrup very slowly into the egg whites, beating constantly on high speed. Add vanilla. Continue beating until mixture is fluffy and will hold it shape and is cool and thick enough to spread of sides and top of cake. You do not want runny frosting.3. Frost cake in layers and sprinkle the top and sides with shredded coconut. Press the coconut into the frosting so that it sticks. Put in a cake keeper and refrigerate. Will keep for up to a week in the refrigerator. The cake actually tastes even better if you allow it to sit for 24 hours because the frosting starts to absorb into the cake.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"DAY 1: THE CAKE","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Preheat oven to 360°.

Lumps of butter the size of pecans should be visible throughout the dough.In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and milk until blended. Add to the flour mixture all at once. Mix on low speed for about 30 seconds or until the dough just barely comes together. It will be a shaggy mess.Dump the dough onto an unfloured surface and gather it into a tight mound. Using your palm and starting on one side of the mound, smear the dough bit by bit, starting at the top and sliding your palm down the side and along the work surface. Do this once or twice on each part of the dough, moving through the mound until the whole mess has been smeared into a cohesive dough with streaks of butter throughout.Gather up the dough, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and press down into a disc about 1 inch thick. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours before using. The dough will keep for up to 4 days in the fridge or 1 month in the freezer.Melt the butter over high heat in a medium sauce pan. Add the apples and stir until they just start to soften, about 2 or 3 minutes. Add the sugar and continue stirring for another 3 to 4 minutes or until the sugar has melted and mixed with the apples. Remove from the heat and transfer the apple mixture to a bowl. Cool for 30 minutes. Add the egg, cinnamon, salt, and flour to the apples and mix with a spatula until they are thoroughly and evenly incorporated.

Prepare the sloppy joes: In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, combine the canola oil, bell peppers, jalapeno and onion; cook for 5 minutes. Add the beef and pork; cook thoroughly, breaking up the meat as it browns. Add the garlic. Depending on the amount of residual grease, you may need to drain some of the fat from the pan. Deglaze with the red wine, then stir in the remaining sloppy joe ingredients (except the rolls) and season with 1 tablespoon each salt and freshly ground pepper. Reduce the heat and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. If the sauce gets too thick as it simmers, add up to 1 cup water to adjust the consistency. Toast the rolls and set aside.                          Meanwhile, prepare the onion straws: In a medium sauce pot, heat the oil to 350 degrees. Whisk the egg and milk in a medium bowl. Mix the flour, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper in another medium bowl. Cut the onion in half, then slice into 1-inch-thick half rings; separate into short straw-like pieces. Add to the milk mixture to soak.

Bring both pots to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and let simmer for 20 minutes, skimming foam from surface as it rises. Remove pot from heat and let beans cool in liquid.Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Fit 2 roasting pans with racks; set aside.Remove thyme leaves from 3 sprigs of thyme. Season ducks, inside and out, with salt, pepper, and thyme leaves. Place two ducks on one rack in a roasting pan, and one duck on another. Add enough water to each roasting pan to come just below the bottom of the racks. Transfer both roasting pans to oven and roast for 45 minutes.Fit another roasting pan with a rack. Season goose, inside and out, with salt, pepper, and sage. Using a fork, prick skin all over and place on rack in roasting pan. Add enough water to come just below the bottom of the rack. Transfer to oven; roast for 1 hour.Place lamb and pork bones on a large rimmed baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper; transfer to oven and roast for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, melt 1/4 cup duck fat in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add lamb cubes, working in batches as necessary, and cook, turning, until browned on all sides; transfer to a plate and set aside. Add pork cubes, working in batches as necessary and adding 1/4 cup more duck fat, if needed, 1 tablespoon at a time (you may not need to use the full 1/4 cup). Cook, turning, until browned on all sides; transfer to a plate and set aside. Add pancetta to skillet, working in batches as necessary, and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned on all sides; transfer to a plate and set aside. Alternatively, melt 1/4 cup duck fat in each of 3 large skillets and, working in batches, brown meat separately in each skillet.Drain fat from skillet; add 1/2 cup of duck fat to skillet and melt over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic to skillet, in batches if necessary, and cook, stirring, until golden, about 10 minutes. Add tomatoes and 1 bottle of wine; let simmer for 15 minutes. Alternatively, if using 3 skillets, divide onion, garlic, tomato, and wine evenly among the 3 skillets. Transfer to stockpots with beans and their liquid, dividing evenly.Remove breast meat from ducks and goose. Remove the legs of each and cut each leg into two pieces; remove bones from thighs. Cut breast and thigh meat into bite-size pieces and set aside. Remove wings and set aside along with drumsticks. Cover meat, wings, and drumsticks and refrigerate overnight. Using a cleaver, halve carcasses; set aside.Place 2 large layers of cheesecloth on work surface. Repeat with another 2 layers of cheesecloth to make 2 separate cheesecloth stacks. Evenly divide duck and goose carcasses, roasted bones, parsley, leeks, carrots, cloves, bay leaves, and remaining 6 sprigs thyme between cheesecloth stacks. Wrap and tie with kitchen twine to enclose. Add one to each pot with beans and add enough water to cover beans by 2 inches. Place pots over medium-high heat; simmer until beans are almost tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Beans should be covered by 2 inches of liquid at all times; if liquid begins to reduce, add water as necessary. Remove from heat and remove as much excess liquid from beans as you can; transfer liquid to an airtight container and refrigerate overnight. Let bean mixture cool for 1 hour; transfer to refrigerator and refrigerate, uncovered, overnight.The next day, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place beans over medium-high heat; bring to a simmer. Remove cheesecloth packets and discard. Skim fat from the surface of reserved bean liquid and divide evenly between the two pots of beans.In a Dutch oven that holds at least 18 quarts, alternately layer the beans with remaining bottle of wine and a mixture of the reserved cubed lamb, pork, pancetta, duck, and goose, seasoning between each layer with salt and pepper. Top the mixture with the reserved duck and goose drumsticks and wings.Make the Topping: In a medium bowl, mix together breadcrumbs, parsley, garlic; season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with duck fat and stir to moisten. Sprinkle evenly over to cover. Transfer Dutch oven to oven and bake until a light-brown crust has formed, 2 to 3 hours.About 1 hour before you are ready to serve, place sausages in a high-sided skillet; add enough water to skillet to cover sausages by three-quarters. Bring water to a simmer over medium-high heat; cook, turning, about 35 minutes. Cover skillet and continue cooking until sausage is cooked through, about 10 minutes more. Remove sausage from casings and cut on the bias into 1/2-inch slices. Top cassoulet with garlic sausage and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Evenly divide chicken stock and beans between 2 large stockpots.

Note  a large cauliflower will make a LARGE crust! Go smaller and use only 1 egg if you want to serve fewer people.\nPut the cauliflower florets in a food processor and pulse until crumbs remain  you want it to almost look like snow. Place all of the cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl and cover it with a paper towel. Microwave for 5 minutes. Remove the cauliflower and spread it on a towel to cool.\nOnce cool, wrap the cauliflower in a towel and squeeze every last bit of water and liquid out of it over your sink. When you think youre finished, squeeze again! You want all of the moisture out. Place the cauliflower in a large (dry) bowl. Stir in the cheeses, seasonings and spices and eggs, mixing until combined. You want to end with a ball of cauliflower dough, so you might need to use your hands to pull it together.\nPlace the dough ball on a piece of parchment paper (no larger than your pizza stone) and press the dough into a circle, making sure the crust is thin. I like to go about 1/4 inch in thickness. Gently pick up the parchment paper and place the entire crust (parch and all) on your pizza stone. Bake for 10 t0 12 minutes, or until golden.  They key here is make the crust crisp and sturdy enough so it doesnt crumble or break apart.\nOnce the crust is golden, (gently) remove it and cover it in your desired toppings. I do sauce first, then cheese and everything listed about, along with more cheese on top. Make the pizza however youd like! Very carefully transfer the pizza (again, still on parchment) back to the pizza stone. Have someone else help you or use a pizza peel. Bake the pizza for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly. Cover with extra parmesan.
