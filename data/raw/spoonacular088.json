mayonnaise and pickle juice in a small bowl. Add the sriracha, a little at a time, adding more to your taste.                          For the pickle mix: Stir together the chopped pickles and grainy mustard. Set aside.                          For the burgers: Put the meat in a large bowl and spread it all over the bottom and a little up the sides. This will help distribute the seasoning evenly throughout the meat. Sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Stir in the mayonnaise.                          Test the seasoning by taking a tiny piece of the meat mixture and forming it into a patty. Set a small skillet over medium heat, add a touch of oil and sear the patty on each side. Let cool slightly and taste. If it needs more salt and pepper, add it to the raw mixture. Repeat the test as needed.                          Divide the meat into 8 equal patties (3 ounces each) and roll each into a ball. Place the balls on a clean surface and use the palm of your hand to gently flatten to 3/4-inch thick and 2 to 3 inches in diameter. Alternatively, use a round cookie cutter to mold the burgers into uniform \"rounds\" by pressing the meat into the mold and making the burgers one by one. Make an indent in the middle of each patty (as the meat cooks the center of the patty will puff up; this will keep the thickness even).                          Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.                          Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat and add just enough canola oil to coat the bottom. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, add the burgers in a single layer with space in between each, cooking in batches if needed. Press the patties down with a metal spatula so they are fairly thin and cook, undisturbed, until the edges brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip using a metal spatula and place a slice of cheese on top of each to melt as the burgers finish cooking. Cook to desired doneness, 3 to 5 minutes longer.                          Place the bun halves on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until light brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Place a dollop of spicy mayonnaise on the bottom halves but don't spread it around. Top with the hamburgers followed by pickle mix, more spicy mayo, and another hamburger. Finish with more pickle mix, spicy mayo and the top buns. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"For the spicy mayonnaise","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Whisk together the mayonnaise and pickle juice in a small bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":93640,"name":"pickle juice","image":"pickle-juice.jpg"},{"id":4025,"name":"mayonnaise","image":"mayonnaise.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the sriracha, a little at a time, adding more to your taste.","ingredients":[{"id":1016168,"name":"sriracha","image":"hot-sauce-or-tabasco.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"For the pickle mix: Stir together the chopped pickles and grainy mustard.

If you've got some spice in your shellfish, a semi-dry riesling can balance out the heat. The Talbott Sleepy Hollow Chardonnay () with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 35 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":436621,"title":"Talbott Sleepy Hollow Chardonnay ()","description":"We select fruit from the finest sections of the acclaimed Sleepy Hollow Vineyard for this Chardonnay. Sleepy Hollow consistently produces Chardonnay with intense tropical fruit character, which exhibits both richness and finesse. Sleepy Hollow Chardonnay is considered by many as one of the quality standards for California Chardonnay. Vineyard Manager and Winemaker Sam Balderas keeps yields low to increase concentration and minimizes the handling of the wine to preserve the fruit's natural essence. This wine is 100% barrel fermented in French Oak and aged on the yeast lees to impart a rich, toasty, complex character to the wine. \n\nTasting Notes for this Vintage\nConcentrated rich flavors of tropical fruit marry with mineral elements and French oak accents. A typically high level of acid produces a long, clean finish. Our signature Chardonnay, this wine can be cellared up to nine years and improves with age.
