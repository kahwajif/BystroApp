Grease an 8x8-inch baking pan.In a large bowl, whisk together the flours, starches, baking powder, salt, and xanthan gum.

The sugar should look like wet sand when you are done.Whisk in the eggs, and once the mixture looks smooth and light yellow, whisk in the milk, oil, and vanilla.Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and stir to combine. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and bake in the preheated oven for 33-37 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.While the cake is baking, whisk together the sugar, lemon juice, eggs, and lemon zest in a LARGE microwave safe bowl (an 8 cup glass measuring cup works well).Microwave the curd for 5-6 minutes, WHISKING EVERY MINUTE, until the curd comes to a boil and thickens. How long this takes will vary depending on your microwave.Place the butter, cut up into cubes, in a glass bowl, and place a mesh strainer over the bowl.

better with fresh. Click on the link above to prepare my homemade pasta. You won't need to use the pasta cutter once the pasta sheets have been rolled and dried on the counter for 15 to 20 minutes. Just lightly flour the sheets (so they don't stick), roll them up and cut them finger-width, about 10 mm. Toss in a bit more flour until you're ready to use them.To cook the Pasta: Boil a pot of water, salt generously then add the pasta. If you're using fresh pasta, they will take only about 3-4 minutes to cook. Reserve some of the pasta water, drain and set aside. (Ideally, you'll want to add the fresh pasta to the boiling water after you've started cooking the rest of the dish so they don't sit too long.)To prepare the mushrooms: Soak the dried porcini mushrooms in 1 cup of very hot water (just under boiling) for about 20 minutes to rehydrate. Reserve the water but strain out any dirt or particles from the mushrooms with a sieve. Roughly chop the fresh mushroomsTo cook: In a pan large enough to accommodate the pasta, heat  cup of the oil and 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. Add the fresh mushrooms and cook for 2-3 minutes then add the garlic and some salt and pepper. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and 1-2 tablespoons of the chopped fresh parsley. If the mushrooms have absorbed too much oil, add another tablespoon or two.Add the mushroom liquid and turn up the heat to medium-high. Cook until the most of the liquid has reduced, about 2 minutes. Feel free to add more oil at this point if you feel it needs it. I like to add it throughout the cooking time. Add  cup of the pasta water, taste for seasoning. Add the chili flakes or chill sauce if using then add a splash of cream just to thicken the sauce a little (2-3 tablespoons). Toss in the pasta. You can add the lemon juice here if you like. Add more pasta water and/or oil if too dry for your taste. Sprinkle the rest of the chopped parsley, plate and serve.

attached.Scrub the radishes.Wash the greens well, coarsely chop them, and keep separate.In a 10 to 12-inch skillet with a tight-fitting lid, melt the butter with the brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt over medium-high heat.Add the water and radishes and bring to a boil.Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer gently until the radishes can be easily pierced with a knife but are not completely soft, about 3 minutes.Spread the greens over the radishes and raise the heat to return the liquid to a boil.Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer gently until the greens are emerald colored and tender, about 5 more minutes.Use tongs to transfer the greens to a large bowl or serving dish, first pressing the excess liquid out of the greens against the side of the pan.Add the vinegar, pepper to taste and a few gratings of nutmeg to the liquid remaining in the pan and bring to a boil over high heat.Boil, uncovered, until the liquid has turned syrupy (you’ll end up with

pot, and whisk them for a bit to get everything incorporated together. Put the pot on the stove over medium heat, and wait for the sauce to start bubbling, stirring occasionally. Let it bubble for about a minute (while stirring a little bit), and then pull it off the heat and set aside, or refrigerate if making ahead.  Pulled pork  Preheat the oven to 300F, and then combine all the dry ingredients for your pork rub, making sure you mix the ingredients well so that everything is evenly distributed. Now rub down your pork. There's a possibility you'll have more rub than you need depending on how big your pork butt is, but that's more good news than bad. Put your rubbed-down butt (haha) in a baking dish and pour in the beer. Cover with foil and throw it in the oven. Every hour after the first couple hours you can go in and baste it a little (or better yet, use a flavor injector; check out this official Food Republic instagram). Depending on your oven and the size of your butt (ha!) it'll take 5-7 hours. Pull it out of the oven and let it cool off a bit before you start pulling it apart with your fingers and removing any unsavory bits (like any bone or fat). Mix the pulled pork with enough sauce (reheated if made ahead) to coat to your liking.  Nachos  Preheat the oven to 350, then arrange a thick layer of tortilla chips on a foil-wrapped cookie sheet, spreading the chips out for as close to 100% cookie sheet coverage as possible.

If you notice a clam shell that does not open, throw it away. Using tongs remove the clams from the skillet and place into a bowl. Add remaining 1/4 cup wine to the skillet and add in pasta. Toss to warm pasta and let it continue cooking until al dente. The pasta will soak up some of the juices in the skillet.

The baked patties with rustic beans and sweet potato paired nicely with the bright carrot and crunchy celery textures.HIS.HERS.Shred, Grate or Shave? I was just feelin' simple, so grabbed my easy hand peeler. You could use a box grater, mandolin shredder and even a fancy food processor. But I just grabbed my hand peeler and shaved the veggies into odd, long and wide, thin shapes. Worked for me!Serving Size: These salads make about 4-5 cups total. Enough to serve 2-3 large portions of up to 6 smaller side portions.Nutritional Facts (sweet version only) entire recipe contains:Calories: 387kcal, Fat: 14g, Carbs: 61g, Protein: 12g, Fiber: 13gRich in vitamins A, C, potassium and iron.Spicy Pepper Carrot Salad (His)4 medium carrots, shredded or shaved3 stalks of celery, shaved or finely chopped3/4 cup flat leaf parsley, finely chopped (including stems)1/4 cup roasted/salted cashews, chopped2 Tbsp raw shelled hemp seeds1 heaping Tbsp tahini 1 tsp extra virgin olive oil1 tsp maple or agave syrup5 dashes fine black pepper3-4 dashes cayenne powder (to taste for heat)2-3 Tbsp fresh lemon juice1/8 tsp fresh lemon zest salt to taste - a few pinches for meOptional: smoky chili powder to taste (or a few splashes liquid smoke)Sweet and Sassy Carrot Salad (Hers)4 medium carrots, shredded or shaved3 stalks of celery, shaved or finely chopped1 cup flat leaf parsley, finely chopped (including stems)2-3 Tbsp raisins, organic2 Tbsp raw shelled hemp seeds2 tsp tahini 2 tsp maple or agave syrup4 dashes fine black pepper1-2 dashes cayenne powder (to taste for heat)3 Tbsp fresh lemon juice1/8 tsp fresh lemon zest salt to taste - a few pinches for meOptional: 1/2 cup sweet onion, chopped or 1/2 cup apple, finely chopped","ingredients":[{"id":1034053,"name":"extra virgin olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":11297,"name":"flat leaf parsley","image":"parsley.jpg"},{"id":10111143,"name":"celery rib","image":"celery.jpg"},{"id":12085,"name":"roasted cashews","image":"cashews.jpg"},{"id":1019037,"name":"avocado slices","image":"avocado-slices.jpg"},{"id":2031,"name":"cayenne pepper","image":"chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":12585,"name":"salted roasted cashews","image":"cashews.jpg"},{"id":1002030,"name":"black pepper","image":"pepper.jpg"},{"id":11819,"name":"chili pepper","image":"red-chili.jpg"},{"id":2009,"name":"chili powder","image":"chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","image":"lemon-juice.jpg"},{"id":93602,"name":"hemp seeds","image":"shelled-hemp-seeds.png"},{"id":9156,"name":"lemon zest","image":"zest-lemon.jpg"},{"id":11124,"name":"carrot","image":"sliced-carrot.png"},{"id":2031,"name":"ground cayenne pepper","image":"chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":11297,"name":"parsley","image":"parsley.jpg"},{"id":9299,"name":"raisins","image":"raisins.jpg"},{"id":11143,"name":"celery","image":"celery.jpg"},{"id":12698,"name":"tahini","image":"tahini-paste.png"},{"id":19912,"name":"agave","image":"agave.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"food-processor.png"},{"id":404778,"name":"box grater","image":"grater.jpg"},{"id":404693,"name":"peeler","image":"peeler.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Also: avocado, sliced for garnish","ingredients":[{"id":9037,"name":"avocado","image":"avocado.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Clean your veggies well - scrub your carrots clean to remove any residue.","ingredients":[{"id":11124,"name":"carrot","image":"sliced-carrot.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Shave, shred or grate your celery and carrot.

Mix again for 10-15 seconds, then let the mixture rest and “sponge” for 20 minutes. Go check your facebook and email.When you come back the mixture should be foamy. Now turn the mixer on low and add 4 more cups of flour and the wheat germ. “Knead” with the bread hook until the dough has come together and pulls away from the sides a little. It should look moist, but if it seems a little too wet add another ½ cup of flour. STOP the mixer. Now spray a piece of plastic wrap with cooking spray and lay it over the mixing bowl. Let it rise for one hour. Go paint your finger and toe nails and let them dry thoroughly. Now back to the bread. The dough should be large, turn the mixer on just long enough to knock it down, close to its original size.Grease and flour two loaf pans. Dump the dough out onto a floured work surface. Flour a knife and cut the dough in half. Roll each piece of dough into a log the length of the loaf pans. Place each roll in its pan. Spray another piece of plastic wrap with cooking spray, cover both loaves loosely so they have room to expand. Walk away. Let the dough rise for another 1 ½ hours. Take a nap, vacuum, pick the kids up from school…When you come back the dough should have doubled in size and come up higher than the lip of the pan.
