Shape it into a rectangle, then roll it to a rectangle about 12x16 inches. Position it with one of the long sides facing you. Spread the peanut butter on the dough thinly covering the entire surface except about an inch on the edge farthest from you. Sprinkle the brown sugar on top of the peanut butter. It doesn't have to be completely even, but try not to have huge clumps of it. If you like, sprinkle a pinch or two of coarse salt on top, as well.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Beginning with the side closest to you, being rolling up the dough, jellyroll style. Don't roll it tightly - you want it to be a bit loose. When you reach the far end, pinch the dough to seal the seam.Cut the dough into 3 even pieces, then cut each of those into 3 pieces for a total of 9. Arrange the rolls, cut side down, in the pan in 3 rows. Flatten the rolls a bit so they are all the same height and they just barely touch each other in the pan.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Divide the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter into pieces and place a bit on top of each roll. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rise until doubles, about 30 minutes.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

If the dough stays a little dry, you may need to add additional water, by the tablespoon until all the flour has been incorporated.Knead dough on a lightly floured counter top until smooth, 5-7 minutes.Place in a greased bowl in a warm place, and cover until you are ready to roll out the crust.(This can be done up to a day ahead of time. Simply refrigerate the crust and remove from the refrigerator 1 hour before you plan to roll it out.)Mix all ingredients together in a small bowl.(The sauce can be made ahead and refrigerated up to a week before using.)Pre-heat oven to 400F.On a lightly floured surface, roll your crust into an 18 inch diameter circle. Transfer rolled dough onto a piece of greased aluminum foil the size of your baking sheet. (It is ok if the dough hangs over the sides of the foil, this is just to make transferring the calzone to the pan easier.)Dividing your dough into thirds, cut 1 – 1 ½ inch thick strips towards the center from the two sides, leaving a 6” wide un-cut band down the center of the crust.Spread your sauce over the center section, leaving 2 inches at the top and bottom un-sauced.Sprinkle your toppings on the pizza sauce, leaving a 1 inch band roughly ¼ of the way down from the top free of toppings. This will be your eye slit.To wrap the mummy, fold the un-sauced bottom up over the toppings. Begin folding each strip over the toppings, alternating sides, and brushing each strip with milk-wash before laying another strip down. (The milk will help the strips stick together and make the crust nice and golden brown.)As you continue from the toes up the mummy, stop when you reach the eye-slit area that you left free of toppings. Fold the top un-sauced portion down and continue wrapping the mummy from the head down.Once your reach the eye slit, be sure to leave a portion uncovered. This is where you will place your olive halves for the eyes.When the mummy is all wrapped, use the aluminum foil to lift the calzone onto your baking pan.

Pour in heavy cream and start incorporating into the cream cheese mixture. It's best to start slow and work your way up in speed. If you try to go too fast at once it will make a mess. Once the heavy cream is combined turn the speed up to high and beat for about 3 minutes until the mixture is thick and creamy. Pour in sugar and continue to beat for another minutes until combined. Carefully spread the mixture on top of the crust (or into jars) and let sit in the fridge for at least 2 hours but can be left overnight as well. When you are ready to serve the cheesecake cut open the passion fruit and pour across the top of the cheesecake.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For crust:In a small mixing bowl add graham cracker crumbs, sugar and melted butter.","ingredients":[{"id":10018617,"name":"graham cracker crumbs","image":"graham-crackers.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"mixing-bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix together until the mixture is moistened.

Be extra careful!Lay the pumpkin on the cutting board hollow side down.Slice the pumpkin into 1/2-3/4\" wide vertical strips.Now slice the pumpkin across the other way in 1/2-3/4\" intervals so that you have nice, even pieces.Place the diced pumpkin in a large sauté pan.Add 1 C. water to the pumpkin.Add the olive oil to the pumpkin along with 1/2 t. of the salt.Place on the stove top on medium/high heat and cover with a lid. When the water starts to boil, reduce the heat to medium. Let cook for 5-10 minutes. Add a little more water if it seems to be getting low or runs out.While the pumpkin is cooking, have your garlic and 1/2 T. of the sage nearby.Check the pumpkin for tenderness. A fork should easily pierce it when its ready.Add the sage and garlic to the pumpkin and sauté for 1 more minute.Transfer the pumpkin mixture to a food processer.Add the parmesan cheese to the mixture and put on the processer lid. Go ahead and start pureeing the mixture on low speed for 1 minute. Add the heavy cream to the mixture and puree again on medium speed until the mixture becomes smooth and creamy.Check the seasonings and add more salt, if needed.Place the pumpkin puree in the area you'll be assembling your lasagna rolls.In a medium bowl, add the ricotta, mozzarella, and 1 t. salt and stir until well combined. Place the mixture in your lasagna assembling area.Look at that pretty sage.

Whisk constantly until the mixture begins to thicken. Add in 1/2 C. more of milk and stir again until it begins to thicken. Add in half of your fontina(besides what you've already reserved!) and whisk it in until it is blended and melted. Add in another 1/2 C. milk and whisk until thickened and blended.(alternating milk and cheese helps to result in a smoother product). Add the remaining cheese and stir until melted. Add in the remaining 1 C. milk and stir until blended and thickened.(use the last 1/2 c. if your sauce needs to be thinner).Check the seasonings for the sauce and adjust.Cover the bottom of your baking dish(use a large one, these rolls are big!) in a layer of brown butter sauce.Lay out a lasagna noodle on your work surface.Place 1/9th of the ricotta mixture on the noodle and evenly spread across.place 1/9th of the pumpkin puree on the ricotta and evenly spread across.Lay 2 zucchini strips lengthwise across the pumpkin puree.Lay 1/9th of the sausage slices evenly across the zucchini.sprinkle 1/9th of the onions evenly across the sausage.

bowl, stir together the cashew butter, maple syrup, coconut flour, crushed freeze dried strawberry powder, and coconut oil. Spread evenly into the prepared pan. Place in the fridge to firm up.Combine the dark chocolate and cashew butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30 second increments, stirring between each, until the chocolate is melted and smooth. It took 1 minute in my microwave. Pour the chocolate over the cashew butter base and spread to cover the top.In a small bowl, whisk together the coconut butter and freeze dried strawberry powder. Pour into a small zip bag or piping bag, and while the chocolate is still warm, drizzle the coconut strawberry butter over the chocolate. I did lines back and forth across the bars, and then ran a toothpick through the lines perpendicularly.

powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, allspice and nutmeg into a bowl. Stir in granulated sugar.Whisk together egg whites, buttermilk, molasses and oil in a large bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the egg white mixture and stir with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula just until blended.Pour into a 9x13 inch pan. Bake at 375 for 15-25 min., or until a cake tester comes out clean. Set aside to cool.Whisk together  cup milk, egg yolks and cornstarch in a large bowl. Heat remaining milk in a heavy saucepan until steaming.Gradually whisk milk into the egg mixture. Return to the saucepan; cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the custard boils and thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in vanilla and about 3 drops yellow food coloring, if using.Transfer to a clean bowl and place a piece of wax paper or plastic wrap directly on the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Set aside to cool slightly.Meanwhile, bring about 1 inch of water to a simmer in a saucepan. Combine egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar and water in a heatproof mixing bowl large enough to fit over the saucepan. Set the bowl over the barely simmering water and beat with an electric mixer at low speed, moving the beaters around the bowl constantly, until an instant-read thermometer registers 140F. (This will take 3 to 5 minutes.) Increase the mixer speed to high and continue beating over the heat for a full 3 minutes. Remove the bowl from the heat and beat the meringue until cool, about 4 minutes.Whisk one-fourth of the meringue into the custard. Add the remaining whites and use a whisk to incorporate them with a folding motion.Peel and de-seed 3 red pears. Cut into slices or chunks, and dip in citrus juice or fruit saver. (I also used some fresh raspberries in the trifle pictured, but I think it would be better with just the pears.)Cut the cake into 1 inch by 2 inch strips. Place a layer of cake in the bottom of a bowl. Sprinkle the fruit on top. Add a layer of custard. Repeat until bowl is full, ending with custard and a little reserved fruit garnish. Chill before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, allspice and nutmeg into a bowl.

Add this mixture to the dry ingredients.Combine the milk and almond extract and add to the batter. Mix all ingredients together until just combined. Fold in raspberries. Pour the batter into the prepared muffin cups. Each cup will be very full. Bake at 400 F for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 375 F and bake for another 20-25 minutes.

Add the flour mixture to the egg yolk mixture and fold just until combined. Fold in blueberries.In another bowl whip egg whites until stiff. SLOWLY fold the whipped egg whites into the muffin batter.  (If you still see streaks or clumps of egg white that is OKAY, it does NOT have to be completely incorporated!)Spoon batter into a greased or paper-lined muffin tins (makes 10-11 large/ bakery-sized muffins or 24 mini-muffins).In a small bowl, mix together streusel topping ingredients.  Sprinkle over unbaked muffins.Bake for 18-25 minutes. Depending on the temperature of your oven, you may have to bake muffins longer. They are done when a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. If you hit a blueberry while testing it will stain your toothpick purple! As long as additional crumbs are not sticking to the toothpick the muffins are done!!Cool muffins on a wire rack.Mix glaze ingredients together.

An interesting nose of plum, cherry, currant, rose, violet, cinnamon and cocoa. On the palate, this wine is elegant and persistent, with a tannic structure and high acidity. It is well-balanced with aromas of flowers and spices evolving on a long and round finish.","price":"$19.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/446740-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9199999999999999,"ratingCount":23,"score":0.9057142857142857,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fcarpineta-fontalpino-chianti-classico-2009%2F116281"}]},"instructions":"In a large bowl, combine water, yeast, honey and olive oil. Mix with a spoon, then let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add in 2 1/2 cups flour and salt, stirring with a spoon until the dough comes together but is still sticky. Using your hands, form the dough into a ball and work in the additional 1/2 cup flour, kneading it on a floured surface for a few minutes. Rub the same bowl with olive oil then place the dough inside, turning to coat. Cover with a towel and place in a warm place to rise for about 1-1 1/2 hours.After the dough has risen, punch it down and place it back on the floured surface. Using a rolling pin or your hands, form it into your desired shape (sometimes I use baking sheets and do rectangles or free form pizzas - this specific dough will yield one pizza large enough to feed about 3-4 people) and place on a baking sheet or pizza peel. Place the towel back over the dough and let sit in the warm place for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, place the ricotta on a paper towel. Press the top of it with another paper towel to release some of the water.Heat theoven to 425 degrees F. (If I use my pizza stone, I heat my oven to 475 degrees and bake for 15 minutes. If you're just using a baking sheet, follow the directions below for baking and set to 425 degrees.)Brush the pizza dough edges with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Sprinkle the garlic cloves on the dough. Spread the ricotta on the dough evenly - so just a bit covers the dough leaving a 1-inch outer rim. Place the peach slices on the pizza. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Cover with the fresh cilantro, basil and rosemary, Carefully pull apart the burrata ball and place it in the center, pulling pieces out towards the edges.Bake for 20 to 25 minutes (or around 15 to 20 minutes if using the pizza stone) until the cheese is golden and bubbly. Remove and top with the spicy microgreens. Slice and serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl, combine water, yeast, honey and olive oil.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix with a spoon, then let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":10,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add in 2 1/2 cups flour and salt, stirring with a spoon until the dough comes together but is still sticky.

Combine 1 1/2 cups of flour, almond flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse to incorporate. Drop butter chunks evenly over surface. Pulse until no dry flour remains and dough just begins to collect in pasty clumps, about 25 short pulses. Redistribute the dough evenly around the bowl of the food processor and sprinkle with remaining flour. Pulse until dough just begins to break apart, about 5 short pulses. Transfer dough to a large bowl.Sprinkle with water and fold and press with a rubber spatula until dough comes together into a ball. Split in half and form into disks. Wrap each disk tightly in two layers of plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight (at this point dough can also be frozen for up to 1 month).On a lightly floured work surface, roll out half of the dough to a circle about 13 inches in diameter. Gently ease the dough into a 9-inch pie pan. Trim edges to a 1/2 inch overhang. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes until ready to use.To prepare the filling, fold blueberries together with lemon juice and almond extract in a large bowl. Sprinkle with sugar and flour and toss to coat. Transfer to chilled pie crust, berries should mound higher in the center (they will shrink when baked). Roll out remaining dough to the same size and thickness as the first. Gently place on top of the berry filling and trim. (Alternatively, you can cut the crust into strips and weave together to form a lattice top). Tuck edge of top piece over and under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp. Refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes.Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Whisk egg and milk together to make an egg wash. Brush the top of crust with egg wash and sprinkle generously with turbinado sugar. If making a solid-top pie, cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape while baking. This is not necessary for lattice-tops. Place the pie on a parchment or foil-lined baking sheet (to catch any overflow) in the middle rack of the oven. Bake for 20 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F and bake for 30 to 40 minutes more or until crust is golden brown and filling is thick and bubbly. (For 6-inch pies, bake for 15 minutes, then reduce heat and bake for 25 to 35 minutes.)
