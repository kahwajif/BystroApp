Sprinkle pieces of pork evenly with salt and pepper and rub into pork. Heat olive oil in a large cast iron pan over medium-high heat. Once oil is hot, add in two of the pork pieces and brown on all sides until well browned, while moving pork as little as possible while browning. Remove pieces and repeat with remaining two pieces of pork, then remove pork and add in onions. Saute onions until golden about 2 minutes per side and adding in garlic during last 30 seconds of sauteing. Reduce heat to medium-low, add in chicken broth, orange juice and lime juice and scrape bottom of pan to loosen browned bits. Return pork to pot, sprinkle evenly with orange and lime zest, chili powder, cumin, paprika, coriander and cayenne pepper and fresh oregano (you want half of the zest/spices to go over the tops of the pork and the other half to go into the broth). Add cinnamon stick to broth in center of pot. Transfer to oven and bake, uncovered in preheated oven 3 - 3 1/2 hours rotating pork once during baking and covering pot at about 2 1/2 hours as needed to prevent excessive browning and to reserve a small amount of broth (you want about 1/2-inch of broth when it's done cooking to toss the shredded pork into).Remove from oven and shred or dice pork into bite size pieces, while removing any pieces of fat. Return to broth in pot and toss to evenly coat. (Optional step) Heat oven to broil and return pot to lower half oven and broil 4 - 5 minutes, then remove from oven and toss. Return to oven and broil 4 - 5 minutes longer. Remove from oven, serve warm over corn tortillas with diced avocados, chopped cilantro and lime juice. Optionally you can also serve with lettuce, Monterey Jack, pico or salsa, hot sauce or sour cream.Slow Cooker Method: Cut roast into 2 halves. Brown roast and other ingredients as listed above, then add all ingredients to a slow cooker, cover and cook on low heat 6 - 7 hours, until tender. Shred roast into bite size pieces. Line a baking sheet with foil. Transfer pork to baking sheet and align in a single layer, pour about 1 cup broth evenly over pork and broil in oven 4 - 7 minutes then toss and broil 4 - 7 minutes longer (I actually ended up pouring more broth over them after broiling for more flavor).Recipe Source: Cooking Classy","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Preheat oven to 275°F. Line large baking sheet with parchment paper. Draw three 10 x 4 1/2-inch rectangles on parchment; turn parchment over. Finely grind 1 cup nuts with 1/4 cup sugar in processor. Coarsely chop remaining 1/4 cup nuts and set aside.

Special Equipment: a jumbo 6-cup muffin tin and jumbo muffin liners                          Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a jumbo 6-cup muffin tin with jumbo liners and generously grease with cooking spray.                          Cook the eggs: Put 6 cold eggs in a medium saucepan. Add enough water to cover by about 1 inch. Bring to a boil, cover, remove from the heat and let sit for 4 minutes. Transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water. Gently crack the eggs so that they fracture all over and let them sit in the water for at least 20 minutes.                          Gently peel the eggs under cold running water. (Older eggs are easier to peel.)                          Make the muffin batter: Melt the 2 tablespoons of soft butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Once the butter starts to foam and cook, add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Add the ham and 1/4 teaspoon salt and continue to stir until browned in spots, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the thyme. Cool in the skillet.                          Combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl.                          Whisk together the milk, sour cream, 4 tablespoons of the melted butter and the 3 remaining eggs in a separate small bowl. Fold the egg mixture, onion mixture, Cheddar and Parmesan into the dry ingredients until just combined (don't fret if there are lumps; it means your batter isn't over-mixed).                          Divide half of the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups. Stand one egg in each cup, nestling it slightly in the batter. Spoon the remaining batter on top of the eggs, using the back of your spoon to spread the batter to make sure each egg is completely covered.                          Lightly brush the top of the batter in the cups with the remaining 2 tablespoons of melted butter. Sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Bake until the muffin tops are golden, 35 to 40 minutes. Let the muffins rest in the hot muffin tin for at least 10 minutes. Remove, cut each muffin in half and serve warm, or transfer to a rack to cool to room temperature, cut and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Special Equipment: a jumbo 6-cup muffin tin and jumbo muffin liners","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404676,"name":"muffin liners","image":"muffin-or-cupcake-forms.png"},{"id":404671,"name":"muffin tray","image":"muffin-tray.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.                          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil and cook the lasagna noodles for 10 to 12 minutes. Drain the noodles and drizzle them with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and then set the noodles aside for later use. (If you are using no-boil noodles, skip this step.)                          Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet set over medium heat and cook the shallots until softened and translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add in the garlic and zucchini, and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the spinach and cook until wilted, 2 to 4 minutes.                          In a large bowl, stir to combine the ricotta, Parmesan, salt, pepper and egg, and set aside for a later use.                          To assemble the lasagna, spoon 1/2 cup of the Chunky Marinara Sauce into the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Top with 3 noodles, slightly overlapping. Spread one-third of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then add one-third of the cooked zucchini and spinach, evenly distributing over the ricotta. Top with 2 cups of the mozzarella, then top with 1 cup of the sauce. Repeat the layering two more times, ending with a layer of noodles and a sprinkle of mozzarella.                          Cover with foil and bake for 40 minutes.                          Remove the foil and continue to bake until bubbling and cooked through, 10 to 20 minutes more. Cool for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.                          Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan set over medium heat and add the carrots, celery and onions, and cook until soft and translucent, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes.                          Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute, then stir in the oregano, chile flakes, tomato puree, chopped tomatoes, basil leaves and some salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 30 minutes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":375,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":3,"step":"Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil and cook the lasagna noodles for 10 to 12 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":10620420,"name":"lasagne noodles","image":"lasagna-noodles.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}],"length":{"number":10,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Drain the noodles and drizzle them with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and then set the noodles aside for later use.

The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.\n\nQuintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

Transfer bacon to a plate lined with paper towels, leaving the drippings in the pan. If you have more than 2 tablespoons drippings, drain the excess. If you don’t have quite that much, supplement with canola oil. When the bacon is cool, transfer to a small bag or tupperware and refrigerate until later.Heat the skillet with the drippings over medium or medium-high heat until rippling and hot. Meanwhile, pat pork chops dry with paper towels and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook pork chops until they are golden brown on each side, about 2 minutes per side, cooking them in batches in the skillet if your skillet isn’t big enough to hold all six at a time in a single layer. When golden on each side, transfer the chops to the slow cooker and repeat with remaining pork.Pour off all but 1 teaspoon of fat from the skillet; add onions, 1 teaspoon brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 cup water to empty skillet. Using a wooden spoon, scrape browned bits from bottom of the pan and cook over medium-high heat until onions are soft, about 4-6 minutes. Stir in garlic and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour onion mixture over chops in the slow cooker. Add broth, soy sauce and remaining 1 tablespoon brown sugar to skillet, bring to a boil and add bay leaves. Pour mixture over onions in slow cooker.Cover slow cooker and cook on low until pork is tender, about 8 hours (or cook on high for 4 hours).When ready to serve, carefully transfer chops to serving platter with a large spoon and tent with foil. Discard bay leaves and pour liquid through a mesh strainer into a saucepan, reserving the solids. Transfer solids to a food processor or blender with 1 cup liquid and blend until smooth. Stir the blended mixture back into remaining liquid in the saucepan. In a small bowl, mix cornstarch and remaining 2 tablespoons water together in a small bowl and stir into sauce. Cook over medium heat until thickened and bubbly, about 5 minutes. Stir in vinegar, season with salt and pepper, pour over chops and sprinkle with reserved bacon and parsley.

a paring knife, make 6 slits along curve from top to bottom of each orange, cutting through peel but not into fruit. Using your fingers, gently remove peel. Reserve fruit for another use. Slice each piece of peel lengthwise into ¼-inch-wide strips. Using a paring knife, remove excess white pith from each strip and discard.Place strips in a large saucepan, and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, then drain. Repeat twice.Bring 4 cups sugar and 4 cups water to a boil, stirring occasionally until sugar dissolves. Stop stirring. Wash sides of pan with a wet pastry brush to prevent sugar crystals from forming. Add strips to boiling syrup, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer gently until strips are translucent, about 1 hour. Remove from heat, and let strips cool in syrup. (Strips in syrup will keep, covered and refrigerated, for up to 3 weeks).Using a slotted spoon, transfer strips to a wire rack placed on a rimmed baking sheet.

Stir until completely and smoothly incorporated; set aside.In a separate medium bowl whisk the cream cheese and salt together until well incorporated; set aside.Combine the remaining milk, cream, 2/3 cup granulated sugar, corn syrup, and ginger slices in a 4-quart saucepan, bring to a rolling boil over medium high heat. Remove from heat and gradually mix in the cornstarch mixture. Return to the heat and allow it to come back to a boil, whisking the entire time.  Remove from heat gradually whisk the hot milk mixture into the medium bowl with the cream cheese mixture. Keep whisking until it’s very smooth, add vanilla, cover and let the flavors infuse for 15 minutes.Pour the mixture into a 1-gallon Ziplock freezer bag. Seal the bag and submerge it in the bowl of ice water. Let the bag become well-chilled, about ½ hour. Replace the ice cubes as needed to keep the water very, very cold.Freeze the ice cream: Pour the chilled mixture through a fine mesh sieve directly into the bowl of the ice cream maker. Discard the ginger slices. Follow the manufacturer’s directions on the machine until the ice cream is smooth, thick and creamy. It should be pulling from the sides just a bit as it churns.Pack the ice cream into a 1-quart storage container, folding the candied orange peels in intermittently as you go. Seal with an airtight lid.

It works best to place them in a large pot of hot water, turn off the heat, and cover for 10-15 minutes. This will prevent the noodles from breaking apart. Drain, and rinse with cold water. Set aside.In a large frying pan, fry the cut up chicken in the olive oil until the meat is no longer pink. Add the garlic and spinach, and continue frying until the spinach is wilted. Remove from heat.In a mixing bowl, combine the Ricotta cheese, egg, and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Stir the chicken/spinach mixture into the Ricotta mixture, and set aside.In the same frying pan you fried the chicken in, over medium heat, cook the onion & red pepper until the onion is translucent. Turn the heat down to medium/low and add the Spinach cream cheese, and stir until the cream cheese has melted. Slowly stir in the milk. Squeeze in the juice of one small lemon. Once it is all incorporated, remove from heatLay the lasagna noodles out on the counter. Cover each lasagna noodle with about 1/2 – 3/4 cup of the Ricotta cheese/Chicken mixture.
