Turn the mixture onto a piece of plastic wrap, shape into a disk then wrap and refrigerate until well chilled and firm. (If your butter was still hot, the mixture may be loose - just stick the bowl in the fridge for a few minutes and allow it to firm up before shaping and wrapping.)To make the ice cream: Add the butter to a medium saucepan and set over medium heat. The butter will melt then begin to bubble and foam before eventually starting to brown - swirl the pan occasionally to help it brown evenly. Continue cooking until it becomes a dark shade of golden brown and smells nutty - be patient and watch carefully, it can go from brown to burned quickly. Add the heavy cream and whisk to combine. Allow the mixture to come to a simmer. Meanwhile, whisk the brown sugar, egg yolks, and salt in a heatproof bowl until pale in color. Slowly add the warm cream mixture to the egg yolks, whisking constantly. Pour back into the saucepan and set over medium-low heat. Stir constantly until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon (about 170-175 F on an instant read thermometer). Strain the custard into a heatproof bowl and stir in the vanilla and whole milk. Cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled (overnight is good). Freeze in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions. Meanwhile, chop the disk of cookie dough into bite-size pieces.

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Holm Oak Tasmania Pinot Gris.

Line a baking sheet with a Silpat or parchment; set aside. Scones - In a large bowl, add 2 cups flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, optional salt, and whisk to combine. Add the butter, and with a pastry cutter or two forks, cut the butter in. You can use a food processor, but I find not having to wash it is a big time-saver. I smoosh the butter with forks and when it's the size of large marbles, I use my hands and knead it in. It will feel like semi-wet, cool sand. Some larger pea-sized butter clumps are okay; set bowl aside. In a small bowl, add the egg, 1/3 cup peanut butter, sour cream, vanilla, and whisk to combine until smooth. Pour wet mixture over dry, and fold until just combined with a soft-tipped spatula; don't overmix or scones will be tough. If dough seems very crumbly or isn't coming together, add sour cream, 1 tablespoon at a time, until moist enough to come together. Add the chocolate chips and fold to combine. Turn dough out onto a Silpat  or clean, lightly floured work surface and with lightly floured hands or a spatula, pat dough into an 8-inch round, approximately 2 inches high. With a large knife, slice round into 8 equal-sized wedges. Using a flat spatula or pie turner, transfer wedges to prepared baking sheet spaced at least 2-inches apart. Do not crowd because scones puff and spread while baking. Bake for about 12 to 15 minutes, or until scones are very lightly golden and cooked through. They set up more as they cool; it's critical not to overbake or scones will be dry. A toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean or with a few moist crumbs, but no batter. Because they're baking in quite a hot oven, watch them closely starting after about 11 minutes to ensure the bottoms aren't getting too browned. Allow scones to cool on baking tray for about 5 minutes before removing and transferring to a rack to finish cooling. While the scones cool, make the glaze. Glaze - In a medium, microwave-safe bowl, add 1/2 cup peanut butter and heat for 30 seconds to soften. Add the confections's sugar, 2 tablespoons cream, and whisk together until smooth. Depending on desired consistency, you may need to play with the cream and sugar ratios slightly. Evenly drizzle the glaze over the scones before serving or frost them like a frosted sugar cookie, which I prefer. If you drizzle the glaze, you'll likely have extra. It will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 1 month; reheat gently in micro before using again. Scones are best fresh, but will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 3 days. I'm comfortable storing glazed items at room temperature, but if you're not, glaze only the scones you plan to consume immediately; I don't recommend refrigerating scones because they'll dry out.

dish","dinner"],"diets":["lacto ovo vegetarian"],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.Place the melted butter and pecans in a baking pan, stir to coat the pecans, and bake 10 minutes. Set aside to cool.Grease and line 2 8-inch baking pans with parchment paper.With an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar together on medium high for about 5 minutes, until light and fluffy.Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula.Turn the mixer town to medium and beat the eggs in one at a time until incorporated.Add the vanilla and beat to combine.In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.With the mixer on low, add the flour mixture and the milk into the creamed mixture in alternating additions, starting and ending with the flour mixture and mix until just combined.Stir in 1 cup of the toasted pecans.Divide the batter between the 2 pans and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Watch the cake carefully at the end of the baking time as it can over bake and dry out quickly.Cool on wire racks for about 10-15 minutes.Run a knife around the edge of the cake pans and turn the cakes out on the wire racks to cool completely.For the Brown Sugar and Cinnamon Swiss Meringue Buttercream:In a large bowl (I used the bowl of my stand mixer), combine the egg whites, brown sugar, and salt.Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water and whisk often. The water should not touch the bowl, since it's the steam that will be heating the egg whites. If they heat up too fast, you'll end up with scrambled eggs.Using a candy thermometer, heat the mixture to 160 degrees fahrenheit while continuing to whisk the mixture. 160 degrees is for food safety issues. If you use pasteurized egg whites, you can stop heating around 120-140 degrees until the sugar has dissolved.Remove the egg whites from the heat and use a whisk attachment to beat the egg whites on medium high until stiff peaks form and the meringue has doubled in volume (about 8-10 minutes). At this point, the meringue should look stiff and glossy, and the bowl should be neutral (not warm) to the touch. If your meringue is still warm, you'll run into problems later.Turn the mixer down to low and mix in the cubes of softened butter, one at a time until they become incorporated into the mixture.It may look curdled at first, but continue mixing until the frosting has become smooth.Add the vanilla extract and cinnamon and beat to combine.To Assemble the Cake:Split the cake layer in half horizontal with the knife to divide them.

Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the pan and fry very gently for another 10 minutes or so. Add the pumpkin pieces, turn well in the oniony oil and then add the vermouth (or wine), the water and chopped tomatoes. Roast in a pre-heated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste for seasoning  I tend to add quite a bit of salt here  and leave to cool.For the tomato sauce: simply pour the chopped tomatoes and water into a large jug or bowl, and stir in the sugar, salt and pepper, whisking it all together.To make up the cheese layer: in a separate bowl beat the goats cheese, cream cheese, Cheddar and ricotta with the eggs, nutmeg, and salt and pepper to taste.To assemble the lasagne, begin by putting 500ml of the cold tomato sauce in the bottom of a roasting tin (measuring approx 36cm x 26cm x 6cm). Then layer with a third of the lasagne sheets, overlapping them well. Leave the rest of the tomato sauce aside for the time being.Layer a third of the pumpkin filling over the lasagne, and dollop on a third of the cheese mixture, coaxing with a rubber spatula. It wont cover completely; think more of spreading blobs about. Then start again with a layer of lasagne, followed by pumpkin, then the cheese. Repeat once more  lasagne, pumpkin, and the last of the cheese mixture. Pour the remaining cold tomato sauce over, letting it sink down and be absorbed in the layers. Slice and chop the mozzarella balls and dot over the top.Cook in the oven, on the baking sheet, for 1 hour. Once cooked, take out of the oven and let it stand for 15-30 minutes to make cutting and serving easier. (I love this when its been standing for an hour or so, too.) As you cut and slice, you will notice a shallow tomatoey cheesy pool at the bottom of the tin; bread dunked into this is gorgeous.Sprinkle the toasted pine nuts over the lasagne, and cut into squares to serve.MAKE AHEAD TIP Up to 2 days ahead, make the pumpkin filling, leave to cool and keep, covered, in the fridge. Make the cheese layer and keep, covered, in the fridge. When ready to use, assemble the lasagne and cook as directed.FREEZE AHEAD TIP Cook, cool and freeze the cooked pumpkin for up to 1 week.

Butter two 9-inch round cake pans, lightly dust the sides of the pans with flour, tap out excess, and line the bottom with circles of parchment paperCook the chili powder in 1 cup of the water in a medium saucepan over medium heat until simmering.  Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the vanilla and set aside.Using an electric stand mixer with a wire whip attachment for the best results, combine the flour, cake flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and cocoa and beat on low speed until well mixed.  Add the softened butter to the dry mixture and beat thoroughly on medium-low speed.  The mixture should have a uniform grainy texture.Increase the speed to medium and gradually add the remaining 1 cup of water and the buttermilk.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Slowly add the hot water-chili mixture to the batter and continue to beat just until well combined, be sure not to over-beat.  Pour the mixture equally into the pans and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of each layer comes out clean, about 35-40 minutes.To cool, set the pans on a wire rack for 15 minutes, and then turn the cakes out onto the rack.  Remove the parchment paper and immediately invert the cakes so that the risen tops don’t flatten.  Let the layers cool completely before frosting.Combine the butter and cocoa in a large saucepan and melt over medium heat.  Remove from the heat and stir in the buttermilk.  Add the powdered sugar, a little at a time, stirring with a wire whisk between additions.  Stir in the bourbon and vanilla and continue to whisk until the frosting is smooth and glossy.  The frosting will stiffen as it cools, but in warm weather you may need to refrigerate it.  Cool to a spreadable consistency.If necessary, trim the tops of the cakes so that they are level.  Place one of the cake layers on a 9-inch round cardboard cake circle.  Spread 1 cup of the frosting over the layer.  Sprinkle 1 cup of the chopped walnuts evenly over the frosting.  Place the second layer of the cake on the frosted base.  Use the remaining frosting to cover the top and sides of the cake.  Press the remaining walnuts into the frosting covering the sides and top of the cake.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees with rack in the center of the oven.

For the graham cracker crust: Mix the graham cracker crumbs, butter, sugar, cinnamon and a sprinkle of salt together in a bowl. Firmly press the crust into muffin tins to make individual crusts. Top each crust with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Press the mini marshmallows into the ice cream, covering the scoop completely. You will have 4 s'more \"domes\". Freeze at least 1 hour. For the quick chocolate sauce: Immediately before serving, heat the broiler to low.

Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours (turning the bag occasionally to re-distribute the marinade).2.  Cut a piece off one end of the corn so that you can stand it flat inside a bowl.  Use a sharp knife to cut down the side of the cob and gather the corn kernels into the bowl.  Set aside.  Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat.  Add the corn, green onions, tomatoes and rosemary. Cook, stirring, 3 to 4 minutes, just until the corn begins to soften and the tomatoes begin to wilt.  Spoon the corn/tomato mixture back into the bowl.  Add vinegar and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.  Let stand at room temperature.3.  Spray a grill rack with nonstick spray.  Preheat the grill to medium-high.  Remove steak from marinade (discard marinade).  Place the steak on the grill rack and grill until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the side of the steak registers 145 degrees F. for medium, 3 to 4 minutes on each side.
