Place beef in a sealable bag and add marinade. Press our excess air from bag, and seal. Marinate, chilled for at least 8 hours or overnight.Heat grill to medium-high. Drain marinade off of meat. Grill ribs, turning once and cooking about 3-4 minutes on each side or cook to preferred doneness. Remove from grill and garnish with sliced green onions and toasted sesame seeds.To make the onion rings:Fill a large heavy bottom pan or fryer with oil and heat to 350 degrees F.Sift dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl and create a well in the center. In a bowl separate lightly whisk the egg yolk with a fork to break it up. Add this to the well in the middle of the flour and slowly whisk from the center, and as you whisk, slowly pour in the beer. Gradually make wider circles with the whisk to incorporate the dry ingredients from the edges - this will minimize any lumps that may occur. Continue whisking until all the dry ingredients are mixed and the batter is of a smooth consistency.Take the onion rings and remove the thin membrane between the layers; (this helps the batter stick better). In a large dish add some rice flour, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Coat each ring in the flour. Dip in the batter and fry the onion rings in batches; cook until golden brown.

Remove the stem and cut the pumpkin in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds and fibers. Stuff each cavity with salt, pepper, 3 thyme and 3 marjoram sprigs. Drizzle a couple tablespoons of olive oil all over the flesh. Turn the pumpkin halves cut-side down onto a foil-lined tray and roast about 1 hour (depending on size), until well softened. Remove from the oven and let cool completely.DOUGH: In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour, ¼-teaspoon salt and pepitos. Pulse several times to grind the pepitos fairly well. Add the butter, water and egg yolks; pulsing several more times until a course meal texture is achieved that holds together when pressed between your thumb and fingers. Dump the mixture onto a large piece of plastic wrap, form into a disc about ½ inch thick, wrap well and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.FILLING: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large skillet heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat. Add leeks and a generous pinch of salt; cook, stirring often, until softened and just beginning to color. About 6 minutes. In a large saucepan combine carrots, 3/4 cup water, 1 teaspoon thyme leaves, 1 teaspoon chopped carrot tops, and 1 teaspoon chopped marjoram leaves, 2 tablespoons butter, and salt and pepper to taste. Heat the mixture over high heat until it comes to a boil, then reduce the pan to a simmer. Cook until carrots are cooked through, gently stirring until most of the liquid has almost evaporated and the carrots are glossy, about 20 minutes. Once the pumpkin is cool enough to handle scrape out the flesh and add it to a bowl. In the bowl of a food processor add a scant 2 cups of the roasted pumpkin mash (reserve the rest for another use), add the leek mixture, 1-cup Parmesan cheese, 2 eggs, ½ cup milk, 1/8 teaspoon salt, remaining 1 teaspoon thyme leaves, remaining 1 teaspoon marjoram leaves and the barest pinch of cayenne pepper. Pulse the mixture 8 or 10 times until it is well-mixed and fairly smooth. The leeks should be the only texture.FINISH THE TARTS: Generously butter 4 (4 ½-inch) tart pans with a fluted edge and removable bottoms. Coat the sides and bottoms with the breadcrumbs. On a well-floured surface, roll out dough to about 1/8-inch thick. Using your tart pans as a guide cut the dough into 4 appropriately sized discs to fit on the bottom only of the tart pans. Fit the discs in the bottom of the pans. Do not press the dough up the sides. Move the pans to the refrigerator to chill about 10 minutes.Remove the cold, dough-lined tart pans from the refrigerator. Spread the pumpkin mixture over the entire surface of the tart pan, filling the pan completely. Smooth the top to level and attractively arrange the reserved carrot slices over the top of each tart. Choose the best and most uniform slices as you will have more than you need. Sprinkle the tarts with the remaining cheese.Bake until well-browned and set. About 30 to 35 minutes. The breadcrumb crust should slightly pull away from the pan. Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool some. When cool enough to handle but still warm, remove the tarts from the pans very carefully. Set aside to cool and serve at room temperature.Share this:ShareGoogleTwitterPinterestFacebookLike this:Like Loading...","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"ROAST THE PUMPKIN: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":400,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Remove the stem and cut the pumpkin in half lengthwise.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Remove the seeds and fibers.

Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti.

Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses.

stand for 30 minutes. In a large bowl, beat egg yolks on high speed for 5 minutes or until thick and lemon-colored. Gradually beat in 1/2 cup sugar. Stir in water and extracts. Sift flour twice; gradually add to yolk mixture and mix well (batter will be very thick).

Preheat oven to 400°.Place squash, cut sides down, on a foil-lined baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Bake at 400° for about 35 minutes or until squash is tender. Let cool slightly and remove skin. Mash the squash pulp and measure out 2 ½ cups. Combine the pulp and evaporated milk in a food processor and process until smooth. Add granulated sugar and next 5 ingredients (through cloves); process until smooth.Increase oven temperature to 425°Heat a small skillet over low heat and add rolled oats. Toast the oats, tossing occasionally until lightly toasted, but not burnt. Set aside.Lightly spoon flour into a dry measuring cup and level with a knife. Combine flour and brown sugar in a medium bowl and cut in butter using two knives or a pastry blender (I prefer a pastry blender). Add chocolate chips and toasted oats and toss to combine.If using dough that was made the day before, allow dough to sit at room temp for 30 minutes before rolling.

onion in the butter until golden brown. Add the thyme and bay leaves and cook for another minute before adding the wine. Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Leave to cool.   For the chicken:   Cut the chicken into large chunks, place in a large plastic container with the lardons and add the cold marinade. Cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 4 hours (best overnight).   Lift the chicken and lardons out of the marinade, then strain through a sieve. Measure 1 1/4 cups marinade, pour it into a pan and set aside. Put the carrots, potatoes and onions into a large pan of cold salted water and bring to a boil. Parboil for 5 minutes, then drain the vegetables into a sieve and hold under cold running water for 2 minutes. Leave to cool.   On a high heat, reduce the marinade by half before adding the vinegar. Mix the cornstarch to a thin paste with some water, whisk into the sauce, and boil for 5 minutes or until the consistency of heavy cream. Add the sugar and season with salt and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it down in direct contact with the sauce. Keep the sauce warm until needed.   Thread the chicken onto the skewers, alternating with the lardons, parboiled vegetables and mushrooms. Brush with the olive oil before cooking on the barbecue (or indoors on a griddle pan) for around 5 minutes, turning regularly. To check the chicken is cooked, cut a piece openthe juices should run clear, not red or pink. Serve with the sauce (reheated in a pan or microwave if necessary).   * Chicken legs have more flavor and tend to be juicier than breast, or you could use boneless chicken thighs (skin on) instead.

Lightly grease the foil.In a mixing bowl, combine the the oats, rice cereal, and almonds.  Set aside.  (Mixing the dry ingredients first allows you to act quickly later when the honey mixture is hot.)Combine the butter, brown sugar, and honey in a large pot. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly.  As soon as the mixture reaches a full boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 2 minutes without stirring. The mixture will look foamy.
