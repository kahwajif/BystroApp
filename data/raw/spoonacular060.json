When the mixture is too thick for stirring with a fork, start using your hands to mix everything together, gradually adding the water, as you start to knead and press the dough. Knead dough for 8-10 minutes until you get a firm, smooth dough. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.Prepare the filling: While the dough rests, combine lamb, onion, parsley and salt in a small bowl. Set aside.Prepare the yogurt sauce: Mix all ingredients in a small bowl. Store in the fridge. (Bring to room temp before serving)Fill Manti: preheat oven to 325F. Cut dough into fourths. (Work with one piece at a time, leaving others covered to prevent drying) Roll dough on floured surface, into a thin sheet, about 1/16 of an inch thick. Use a knife or a pizza cutter to cut into 1-inch squares. (you can use the edge of a ruler as a guide) Add a small ball of meat - about the size of a chickpea - to the center of each square. Pull the four corners up around the meat and press the four side seams firmly together to seal. Set manti onto a baking sheet, lined with parchment paper. (you'll need two baking sheets) Repeat with the rest of the dough. You should have about 120 manti. Bake manti for 15 minutes, until it just starts to brown. At this point you can let the manti cool and store it in the fridge for up to a day or in the freezer for up to two weeks. Allow to come to room temp before continuing.Prepare the tomato sauce Cook oil and tomato paste in a small pot over medium low heat, stirring constantly, for about 7 minutes, until you get a deep rich color and oil is incorporated. Add Aleppo (or paprika and red pepper) and cook, stirring for 30 seconds longer. Remove from heat. Add water and whisk to combine. Set aside. (Reheat just before serving)Prepare butter sauce: Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk constantly for 1-3 minutes, until you see little brown flecks appear. Remove from heat. Add olive oil. Set aside.Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add manti and cook at a gentle boil 10-12 minutes, until tender. Drain. Return manti to its cooking pot. Pour butter sauce over and toss to coat, reheating gently, if need be. Season with salt, to taste. Divide manti between 6 bowls. Spoon on the tomato sauce and yogurt. drizzle on any extra butter sauce. Sprinkle with spices.

When the potatoes have cooled, peel them and cut them in small pieces then mash them with the 1 stick of butter. Add in the 3 eggs and 1 cup of the flour and continue mashing until smooth.In the bowl of your mixer add the water, yeast and sugar, stir and let it sit for about 10 minutes until yeast has dissolved and it becomes foamy.Add potato mixture to the yeast mixture and using the paddle attachment mix for a couple minutes. Add 3 more cups of flour, one cup at a time and mix well. If the dough is too dry add a bit more water, but I didn't need too, there was enough moisture from the sweet potatoes. After the 3 cups of flour have been added in the dough should still be sticky.Sprinkle about half a cup of flour over your work surface and scrape the dough onto the floured surface. Knead the dough until it's smooth and elastic, I only kneaded for about a minute, but it depends how sticky your dough is. Butter or oil a large bowl and place the dough in there, cover it with foil and let sit in a warm place until it doubles in size, about an hour. Usually I turn the oven on to 200 F degrees for 1 minute, then turn off the oven and place the bowl in the oven and let it rise in the warm oven, it speeds up the rising process.In the meantime, make the filling by mixing all the ingredients in a bowl using a fork.After the dough has doubled in size, preheat the oven to 425 F degrees. You will need a large baking sheet for this.Turn the dough onto your floured surface and roll it out so that it's about 24 inches by 16 inches and about ½ inch in thickness. Sprinkle or spread the filling evenly over the dough. Working carefully, from the long edge, roll the dough down to the bottom edge.Carefully cut the roll into 12 equal size rolls, so the easiest is to cut the roll in half then cut each half in half and then each quarter in 3 so you end up with 12 equal size rolls. Transfer the rolls onto the baking sheet, wrap with plastic wrap and let rise for another 20 minutes.Bake the rolls for about 15 to 20 minutes until they are golden brown.In the meantime make the icing by whisking all the icing ingredients together.

Grease and flour two round 9 by 2-inch cake pans. Pour about a tablespoon of flour into each of the pans and roll it around, tapping as you go, until the sides and bottom are covered completely with a thin layer of flour. Tip the pans, and tap out excess flour.                                                                2 In a large mixing bowl, mix thoroughly with a whisk the flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda.                                                                3 In a separate large bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer until creamy, about 30 seconds. Add the sugar in 1/2-cup measures, beating about 15 seconds after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl if necessary, until the mixture has lightened in color and become fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs and egg yolks, one at a time, and the vanilla, beating for 15 seconds after each addition.                                                                4 Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in thirds, alternating with additions of the milk. To avoid overmixing the batter, mix gently with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula after each addition, until the ingredient is just incorporated. Beat until all the ingredients have been incorporated, and then just a few strokes beyond. Divide the batter between the cake pans and spread the tops evenly.                                                                5 Bake until a cake tester or toothpick emerges clean, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let the cakes cool in their pans on a rack for 10 minutes, then slide a thin paring knife around the edge of the pans, and invert the cakes. Turn each cake again so its rounded top is facing up, and cool the cakes completely on the rack.                                                                6 Make the icing: Pour the milk and 3 cups of the sugar into a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, mixing with a whisk. Add the butter and the salt, whisking occasionally until the butter melts. When mixture just simmers, cut the heat, but keep over the warm burner.                                                                7 Pour the remaining 1 cup sugar into a saucepan. Cook the sugar over medium-high heat until it becomes a syrup, stirring every so often with a wooden spoon as it begins to brown, until the sugar syrup is evenly amber colored, 5 to 8 minutes. Pour the syrup into the warm milk mixture, being very careful, as the caramel will bubble and sputter when it hits the hot milk. Turn the heat beneath the pot to high and, whisking gently until all the syrup has completely dissolved into the roiling milk mixture, continue to cook to the soft-ball stage, about 238°F; this may take 8 to 12 minutes.                                                                8 Cut the heat beneath the caramel and gently whisk in the vanilla and the baking soda. Dip a spoon into the caramel, and let it cool to taste it. Season the caramel to taste with salt, and pour it into the bowl of a standing mixer (or use an electric hand-mixer and a large bowl). Beat on low speed as it cools, 15 to 20 minutes depending on the temperature of your kitchen, until the icing is creamy and thick (between 100°F and 105°F). Remove the bowl from the mixer stand and let cool 5 to 10 minutes more, until the icing is between 95°F and 98°F—it should fall off your spatula in a ribbon that remains discernible on the surface of the icing for 10 seconds.                                                                9 Set the first cake layer on a rack set over a sheet plan lined with waxed paper. Have an electric hand-mixer and the hot water nearby to blend a teaspoon or two into the icing if it becomes too thick to spread. Pour enough of the icing over the cake to cover the top in a layer about 1/4 inch thick (if it drips over the edge in places, that's fine; this is an early test of whether it's going to set in place or not). Top the first cake with the second cake layer and pour the rest of the icing in stages over the top of the cake, letting it run down the sides and using an icing spatula to guide the icing around the cake as it drips, until the entire cake is covered, for a traditional, classic look. (If you prefer the dramatic look of cake layers peeking out from behind a curtain of icing drips, by all means choose that route!) If you need to reuse any icing that overflows into the pan, simply move the cake on its rack temporarily, scrape up the icing from the waxed paper with a spatula and return it to the bowl, replace the rack over the pan, and continue to ice the cake.                                                                10 Once the icing has set, using two spatulas carefully transfer the cake from the rack to a cake stand and let stand at room temperature beneath a cake dome until ready to serve. Only refrigerate if you plan to store the cake for more than 2 days.                                                                            Reprinted with permission from The Lee Bros.

It should take all of the dates.
