Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8073684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Ffonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998%2F12434"}]},"instructions":"Put the slow cooker onto the High or the browning setting and tip in the crushed garlic, canned tomatoes, half the oregano leaves, chilli and some seasoning.

Place point side down near the top center of a greased baking sheet. Roll up two wedges; place in the second row with sides touching. Repeat, adding one roll per row, until tree has four rows. Roll up another wedge and center below last row for the trunk. Repeat for second tree, using 11 more wedges and a second baking sheet. Roll up remaining two wedges; place one on each baking sheet.

For the crust: Spray a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray. Add the graham crackers and sugar to the bowl of a food processor and process until fine crumbs form (you should have about 1 1/2 cups). Add the margarine and 2 tablespoons water to a measuring cup and melt in the microwave; add to the crumbs and blend until the mixture looks like wet sand. Pour the crumb mixture into the prepared pan; press it evenly into the bottom and use a measuring cup to smooth it evenly about 2 inches up the side. Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes.

Sear the filets in a screaming hot pan for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until a nice brown crust has formed.\n\nWhile the steak is searing, spoon the butter and oil over each filet to give it a butter bath as it cooks. (yum)\n\nOnce both sides are seared, transfer the steaks to a baking sheet and cook for 6-8 minutes in the center of your oven.\n\nYour steak will be medium rare when it is approximately 135 degrees in the center, or when you push lightly on the top center of the steak and it gently and slowly bounces back.

Let sit about 10 minutes or until frothy.  Add 2 1/2 cups of the flour and salt, and stir or mix with a dough  hook on low speed until the dough comes together. With the dough hook or by hand, work in the remaining 1/2 cup flour, kneading until smooth, about 5 minutes. Brush bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning to coat. Cover with a clean tea towel and let sit in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.Divide dough in half. If you are only making one pizza, place remaining dough in a zip-top bag. Refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze until ready to use; thaw overnight before rolling and baking.Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Preheat a 9 or 10-inch cast iron skillet in the oven or on the stovetop over medium heat.On a lightly floured pizza peel or cutting board, press or roll dough into a 10-inch round the same size as the base of your skillet. Take care that your surface is floured enough so the dough will slide around freely. Lightly brush edges with olive oil. Spread tomato halves in a single layer over dough, and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Gently slide the dough into the hot skillet. Bake for 10 minutes or until cheese is melted.Toss Brussels sprouts with 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, and pepper. Remove partially-baked pizza from the oven (be careful, the handle will be very hot!) and top with a mound of Brussels sprouts. Sprinkle with pancetta and goat cheese and return to oven for another 8 to 10 minutes, or until crust is golden brown and Brussels sprouts are crispy and browned around the edges.
