a small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin evenly over top and let soften for 5 minutes.In a medium saucepan, combine sugar, 1/4 cup of the corn syrup, water, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heaat, stirring occasionally, until the temperature reaches 240F on a candy thermometer. Meanwhile, pour remaining 1/4 cup corn syrup into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.Microwave gelatin on high until completely melted, about 30 seconds. Pour it into the mixer bowl. Set the mixer speed to low and keep it running. When the syrup reaches 240F, slowly pour it into the mixer bowl.Increase the speed to medium and beat for 5 minutes. Increase to medium-high and beat for 5 more minutes, beating in the vanilla during the last minute until marshmallow is shiny white and tripled in volume. Spread half of the marshmallow it into the prepared pan, smoothing it into the corners with an offset spatua. Sprinkle with chopped Goo Goo candy, then top with remaining marshmallow. Let set for at least 6 hours in a cool, dry place to set.For graham crackers, place graham flour, all purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon into the bowl of a food processor and pulse several times to combine. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles cornmeal. Add the molasses, milk and vanilla extract and process until the dough forms a ball, approximately 1 minute. Gently knead and shape the ball into disk;wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.On a lightly-floured surface, roll dough to 1/8-inch thick. Cut into 2 1/2-inch squares (or other shapes as desired) Using a fork or skewer, poke holes all over the top of the dough. Transfer to prepared baking pan and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the edges just start to darken. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes, then transfer cookies to cooling racks to cool completely. (This recipe will make more cookies than you need for the s'mores; they will keep in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.)To assemble, use a knife to loosen the marshmallow from the parchment paper and transfer to a cutting board. Cut into squares just slightly smaller than your graham crackers (a pizza cutter or sharp, oiled knife works best, or you can use the same cookie cutters as you did for the graham crackers). When you are ready to serve (don't assemble too soon beforehand or the cookies will get soft) place one marshmallow square on top of one cookie. Toast using a kitchen torch, or place under the broiler for 60 to 90 seconds (watch it carefully). Place a second cookie on top and press firmly until the marshmallow begins to ooze. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Line a 9-by-9-inch baking pan with parchment paper; spray lightly with cooking spray and dust with powdered sugar.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404770,"name":"baking paper","image":"baking-paper.jpg"},{"id":404646,"name":"baking pan","image":"roasting-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place cold water in a small bowl.

The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.\nThis wine has a broad range of food pairings, whether alone with some well chosen cheeses, richer fish preparations or a good old steak on the barbeque.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438099-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":8,"score":0.82,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fdutton-goldfield-dutton-ranch-pinot-noir-2014%2F154141"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium high heat. Once hot add one corn tortilla at a time and cook 10 - 15 seconds per side (until tortillas become more pliable), then immediately transfer to a plate and cover with a skillet lid (to seal in moisture. Be sure it's a lid that will basically seal on bottom, as in there shouldn't be any space between the plate and the lid. This should prevent tortillas from cracking). Repeat with remaining tortillas and set aside.In a large non-stick heat 1/2 Tbsp of the canola oil over medium-high heat. Once hot add onions and saute until soft and slightly golden, about 3 - 4 minutes, adding in garlic during last 30 seconds of sauteing. Remove skillet from heat, then add salsa verde and diced cream cheese. Reduce heat to medium-low, and return skillet to heat. Cook stirring constantly until cream cheese has melted. Add in chili powder, paprika, cumin, lime juice and season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat and stir in shredded chicken, cilantro and monterey jack cheese (you can add in another 1 - 2 Tbsp if of the salsa verde if you think it needs it, you want it to be creamy but not too wet or it will keep the taquitos from getting perfectly crisp). Spread about a scant 1/4 cup (about 3 Tbsp) of the chicken mixture in a row, closer to one side of the tortilla (about 1-inch from edge), then snuggly roll tortilla to opposite side. Place on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Repeat process with remaining tortillas and chicken mixture, spacing tortillas at least 1-inch apart on baking sheet for even toasting. Brush tops and sides of rolled tortillas lightly with remaining 1 Tbsp canola oil. Bake in preheated oven until edges are golden brown and taquitos are crisp, about 18 - 20 minutes. Serve warm with dipping of choice (i.e. sour cream, salsa verde, guacamole, tomato salsa, hot sauce).*I wouldn't recommend using the corn tortillas they've recently come out with that are now \"softer and improved.\" Some brands still stick with the regular kind (they are more firm and not as pliable) and I tested out both for these and the regular version worked out better and didn't break at all whereas the newer kind did.

your macaroni isn’t mushy or overcooked!In a large saucepan, melt butter. Whisk in flour to make a roux and cook for 1 minute.Whisk the milk into the roux a little at a time, making sure to work out all the clumps so you have a smooth sauce. Cook over medium heat until milk has thickened, about 8 minutes.Remove sauce from heat. Stir in 2 and 2/3 cups of the cheddar cheese with a spoon or spatula.

In a mixing bowl beat butter on medium high speed for 30 seconds. Add brown sugar. Beat until combined. Add egg; beat well. Beat in flour until combined. Divide dough in half. Cover one portion and set it aside.Remove the sides from a 10-inch springform pan and set aside. Spread first portion of dough on just the bottom of ungreased springform pan base, spreading dough to edges. Place on baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Cool completely. When cool, attach sides of pan. Press chilled dough onto the sides of the sprinform pan to a height of 1-3/4 inches, using a thin metal spatula, like an offset spatula, to spread dough.For the filling: reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees. In an extra-large mixing bowl beat cream cheese and sugar until fluffy. Beat in the flour on low speed until smooth. Add eggs and vanilla all at once, beating on low speed just until combined. Mix in sour cream and lemon peel. Then, using a wooden spoon or a spatula, gently fold in pomegranate seeds (if you use the electric mixer for this part, the seeds will burst and stain the filling with the juice – and it won’t look as pretty).Pour filling into crust-lined pan.

(It doesn’t matter if the cheesecake cracks on top since it will have a sour cream topping.)For the topping: stir together sour cream, sugar, and vanilla.

Loosen crust from sides of pan. Cool for 30 minutes more. Remove sides of pan; cool completely.

flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt to a bowl. Mix to combine and set aside. Grease 3 8-inch round cake pans. Line with parchment paper, then butter/spray with cooking spray and flour the pans.in a microwave safe bowl add the butter and chocolate. Microwave on high for 30 seconds intervals stirring in between until melted, this took me a total of 1 minute 30 seconds. Once melted stir in the bourbon and coffee. Set aside.In the bowl of a stand mixer add the 4 eggs and 2 egg yolks and sugar. Beat on medium-high speed for about 4 to 5 minutes until light and fluffy and pale in color. Add the canola oil and greek yogurt. Mix to combine. Carefully add in the chocolate mixture until well combined and smooth. Scrape the bottom of the bowl and make sure everything is well mixed, beat one last time.Add the flour mixture and stir until just combined. It is ok to have the batter be lumpy, but just make sure you do not have too many big chunks of flour in the batter.Pour the batter among the three cake pans and bake 20 to 25 minutes, until the tops are just set and no longer wiggly in the center. Remove and let cool five minutes, then run a knife around the edges of the pan. Grab 3 large flat plates, line them with wax or parchment paper and invert the cakes onto the paper lined plates. Cover and let the cakes cool completely before frosting. I like to stick my cakes in the freezer (well covered) for 1 hour or up to 1 day and then fill and frost the cake while it is frozen. Trust me it makes things much easier.While the cakes cool make the filling and frosting. For the peanut butter filling, add the butter and peanut butter to the bowl of a stand mixer (or you can use a hand held mixer) and beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla and beat until combined and smooth. Remove from the bowl and set aside.To make the chocolate frosting, In the now cleaned mixing bowl add the butter, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, meringue powder, vanilla and 2 tablespoon milk. Beat on medium speed for 5 minutes, scraping down the sides until the frosting is light and fluffy. If the frosting is too thick add milk to thin. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside.Now grab your cakes. Place one cake on a cake plate or platter and add a large dollop (about 1 cup) of the peanut butter filling. Using a knife, or offset spatula, spread the filling out to the edge of the cakes, but leave about 1/4 to 1/8 inch border. Now grab another cake, place it right on top of the peanut butter layer. Add another large dollop of filling and spread out to the edges. Grab the last layer and place it (rounded side down) on top of the peanut butter layer. Add a small dollop of the peanut butter filing and spread out in an even thin layer.Now take the chocolate frosting and add a large dollop right on top of the cake. spread the frosting evenly on the top and sides of the cake. You should have just enough frosting to do the the whole cake.To make the ganache, in a microwave safe bowl add the chocolate and cream. Microwave on high for 30 second intervals, stirring between each until melted. Once melted stir in the bourbon. Pour the ganache on to the middle of the cake and spread to just the sides, allow the ganache to drip down the sides of the cake. Let sit 30 minutes before decorating with buckeyes.If desired, top the cake with buckeyes and store in the fridge, or on the counter.To make the chocolate Buckeyes, In a large bowl or bowl of a stand mixer, beat together 3/4 cup peanut butter, 1/2 butter, 1 tablespoon vanilla and 3 cups powdered sugar. The dough will look dry. Roll into 1 inch balls and place on a waxed paper-lined cookie sheet. Press a toothpick into the top of each ball and chill in freezer until firm, about 30 minutes. Melt 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips in the microwave on 30 second intervals (or in a double broiler on the stove), stirring until smooth. Remove the balls from the freezer and dip the balls in chocolate holding onto the toothpick. Leave a small portion of peanut butter showing at the top to make them look like Buckeyes. Put back on the cookie sheet and refrigerate until ready to put on the cake. Once the buckeyes are cold place a few on top of the cake.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.To make the cake, add the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt to a bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":19165,"name":"cocoa powder","image":"cocoa-powder.png"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix to combine and set aside.

and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Tilapia. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Fetzer Vineyards Valley Oaks Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 11 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428373,"title":"Fetzer Vineyards Valley Oaks Pinot Grigio","description":"This Pinot Grigio is clean with a fruit forward character and a crisp acid backbone .

peaks form. Set aside. Tip: Use a stand mixer; a hand mixer is not likely to have enough power for the heavy texture of the candy.In a medium-size heavy-bottomed pan, combine  cup sugar, 2 tablespoons corn syrup, and  cup water. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Stir gently to avoid splashing the mixture onto the sides of the pan. Tip: Rub a drop of the warm sugar mixture between your fingertips to make sure it feels smooth, with no trace of sugar granules. If the mixture feels sandy, continue warming and stirring until the mixture is smooth.When the mixture begins to simmer, cover the pan tightly with a lid for 3 to 4 minutes to allow condensation to form and run down the inside of the pan to help wash away stray sugar crystals.Remove the lid and increase the heat to medium high and bring to a boil, without stirring, until the syrup reaches a temperature of 250 degrees F, a hard ball stage, using a candy or instant read thermometer to gauge the temperature. While the syrup is cooking, wash away any sugar crystals that form on the sides of the pan by wiping upwards with a damp pastry brush so the sugar crystals dont fall back into the syrup.Meanwhile, as the temperature of the syrup reaches about 240 degrees F, continue beating the egg whites on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form. Stop the mixer, remove the whisk attachment and attach the paddle.When the sugar mixture reaches 250 degrees F, Immediately remove pan from the heat. Tip: Lower the heat when the temperature reaches about 240 degrees to slow the cooking because at this point it will quickly reach 250 degrees. In addition, remove the pan from the heat just before the syrup reaches 250 degrees to prevent it from going over 250 degrees.Immediately start pouring the hot sugar mixture, in a thin steady stream, into the beaten egg whites, while beating with the electric mixer at medium-low speed. This will cause the egg whites to double in volume. Be careful, the sugar is extremely hot and will burn your skin if you touch it. Continue beating at medium-low speed until the candy cools, about 7 minutes. Tip: Keep the mixer running on low speed to prevent the mixture from setting up while the stage 2 mixture is being prepared.Meanwhile, as the Stage 1 mixture is cooling, in a clean medium-size heavy-bottomed pan, combine 2 cups sugar,  cup corn syrup, and  cup water. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Stir gently to avoid splashing the mixture onto the sides of the pan. When the mixture begins to simmer, cover the pan tightly with a lid for 3 to 4 minutes to allow condensation to form and run down the inside of the pan to help wash away stray sugar crystals.Remove the lid and increase the heat to medium high and bring to a boil, without stirring, until the syrup reaches a temperature of 270 degrees F, a soft crack stage, using a candy or instant read thermometer to gauge the temperature. While the syrup is cooking, wash away any sugar crystals that form on the sides of the pan by wiping upwards with a damp pastry brush so the sugar crystals dont fall back into the syrup.When the sugar mixture reaches 270 degrees F, Immediately remove pan from the heat. Tip: Lower the heat when the temperature reaches about 260 degrees to slow the cooking because at this point it will quickly reach 270 degrees. In addition, remove the pan from the heat just before the syrup reaches 270 degrees to prevent it from going over 270 degrees.Immediately start pouring the hot sugar mixture, in a thin steady stream, into the cooled stage 1 mixture, while beating with the electric mixer at medium-low speed. Be careful, the sugar is extremely hot and will burn your skin if you touch it.Slowly add the vanilla. Add butter and salt. Increase the speed to high and continue beating at high speed until the candy cools and changes from a smooth shiny texture to a rough dull texture. This can take anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes. As soon as the texture changes to the rough dull texture, stop beating and remove the bowl from the mixer.Quickly pour the divinity onto the prepared pan. Let the divinity set until just it is cool enough that you can handle it.Separate divinity into 4 equal portions and roll each portion into a log about 5 inches long. Wrap each log in parchment paper and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 4 to 6 hours or overnight. Keep refrigerated until ready to dip in the caramel coating.In a large heavy-bottomed pan, combine granulated sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, butter, and salt. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, until the sugar is completely dissolved and the butter is melted. Stir in the whipping cream. Stir gently to avoid splashing the mixture onto the sides of the pan. Increase the heat to medium high and bring to a boil, stirring frequently and scraping the pan bottom to avoid scorching, until the mixture reaches a temperature of 250 degrees F, a firm ball stage, using a candy or instant read thermometer to gauge the temperature. Immediately remove pan from the heat. Tip: Lower the heat when the temperature reaches about 240 degrees to slow the cooking because at this point it will quickly reach 250 degrees.Let the hot mixture sit about 30 seconds to let the bubbling subside. Working carefully to prevent splattering, add the vanilla and stir just until mixed.Line a baking pan with parchment paper or waxed paper.Placed chopped peanuts in a shallow dish, such as a pie plate.Remove the divinity rolls from the refrigerator. Place one roll at a time in the hot caramel; gently turn it over with a kitchen fork or wooden spoon. Use the fork or wooden spoon to lift the roll out of the caramel, letting excess caramel drip back into the pan. Be careful, the caramel is extremely hot and will burn your skin if you touch it. Immediately place the caramel covered roll into the pan of chopped peanuts and roll until completely covered with the peanuts. Lift the roll out of the peanuts and place on the prepared pan. Refrigerate the rolls about 30 minutes for the caramel to become cool and firm.Slice rolls into about  inch slices. This is a softer candy then regular divinity due to the addition of the butter, and is best refrigerated.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites on medium speed until soft peaks form.

Drain and let cool for 20 to 30 minutes. Slice potatoes into 1/4'' rounds. You will need 18 rounds for this recipe.Heat grill pan over medium-high heat. Spray pan with non-stick cooking spray. You could also use an outdoor grill for this part, using the same medium-high heat.In a small bowl, whisk together honey and balsamic vinegar. Dip potato rounds into honey balsamic mixture and place on hot grill pan. Sprinkle potatoes with a bit of kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Grill for 2 to 3 minutes, or until potatoes have beautiful golden grill marks. Then flip the potatoes and grill for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden grill marks are achieved again. Remove grill pan from heat. To assemble, place a grilled potato round on a small plate (for individual servings) or a large platter (for serving family style). Top with a rounded teaspoon, more or less to taste, of pesto, spreading it out across the potato round. Place a mozzarella medallion on top of the the pesto, followed by a tomato slice. Repeat the stacking with another layer...potato, pesto, mozzarella, tomato. And then top with a third grilled potato slice and a bit of pesto. Press a skewer or pick (mine were about 4'' long) down through the center of the stack to stabilize. Drizzle a bit of balsamic glaze over the top, letting it run down the sides of the caprese stack. If desired, top with a basil leaf for garnish, and sprinkle with additional salt and pepper.Serve at room temperature.Note: I used a balsamic glaze that I found at the grocery store. But you can substitute with a simple homemade sweet balsamic reduction. In a small saucepan, bring 1 cup balsamic vinegar to a boil. Reduce heat to medium/medium-high and cook until the vinegar is thickened (like a thin maple syrup), about 10 minutes. Remove pan from heat and stir in 2 tablespoons of honey. Let cool completely. The glaze will thicken a bit more as it cools. This glaze can be made ahead of time and refrigerated, just let it come to room temperature while you prepare the caprese stacks.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Boil potatoes just until tender throughout, about 12 minutes or so.","ingredients":[{"id":11362,"name":"potato","image":"potatoes-yukon-gold.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":12,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Drain and let cool for 20 to 30 minutes.

If using Pumpkin Patch pan, prepare the cake wells with cooking spray or by greasing and flouring them.  If making cupcakes, prepare the wells with cupcake papers.                    Sift together the dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and the five spices.  Set aside.                    In the bowl of a standing mixer (or in a large bowl using a hand mixer) beat butter until smooth.   Add the brown sugar and granulated sugar; beat until fluffy, scraping sides of mixing bowl if necessary.                    Add eggs to butter-sugar mixture, allowing each egg to be fully combined before adding the second egg.

Allow cake pan to cool on cooling rack for 15 minutes.  If using the Pumpkin Patch pan (not making regular cupcakes), use a serrated/bread knife to cut off any cake that has rise above the top of the pan before removing them from the pan.  Place the knife on its side flat on the top of the cake pan, gently slice back and forth, keeping the knife flush with the pan to create a flat bottom for the pumpkins.   Turn cakes out of pan and allow them to cool to room temperature before decorating.                    To Make Mini Pumpkins:  If using the Pumpkin Patch you will note there is a leaf design on the top of half of the cake wells.  To make a full mini pumpkin, find the corresponding size top and bottom and place them together in the correct orientation.  After glazing, frosting or simply sifting with powdered sugar, insert part of a cinnamon stick as a stem making sure its removed before eating!  Half pumpkins are cute too; just use one of the cakes and decorate as you choose.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Heat in microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring well between intervals until melted and smooth, set aside to cool slightly. Meanwhile add flour to a medium mixing bowl, sift in cocoa powder and add baking powder and salt. Whisk mixture to combine. Set aside.In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment blend together brown sugar, eggs, peppermint extract and vanilla. Mix in chocolate mixture. With mixer set on low speed slowly add in flour mixture and mix just until combined. Cover bowl and chill 1 hour or until firm enough to handle (I actually divided the dough into two containers and it chills faster). Preheat oven to 325 degrees during last 10 minutes of chilling.Scoop dough out about 1 lightly heaping tablespoon at a time. Shape into a ball then transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat, spacing cookies 2-inches apart (keep remaining dough chilled). Bake in preheated oven until slightly under-baked, about 9 minutes. Meanwhile cut marshmallows into halves using kitchen scissors. Remove cookies from oven and add 1 marshmallow half to each cookie placing the cut side downward. Return to oven and bake about 2 - 3 minutes longer until marshmallows have begun to melt. Remove from oven and gently press down on marshmallows to flatten slightly. Cool on pan several minutes then transfer to cookies to wire racks and set wire racks over a baking sheets (to catch icing in the next step. I actually like to enjoy some of the cookies warm so I'll make the icing while the last batch of cookies is baking).For the icing:Sift powdered sugar and cocoa into a medium mixing bowl, set aside. Heat butter and cream over medium heat and cook, stirring frequently until butter has melted and mixture reaches a simmer. Remove from heat, pour in powdered sugar and cocoa powder and whisk until smooth. If mixture is too thick thin it with a little hot water, if it's too thin thicken with a little more sifted powdered sugar. Immediately spoon icing over cookies (or alternately drizzle from a resealable bag wth a cut corner) and sprinkle each cookie with crushed peppermint after adding icing because the icing will start to set quickly.Recipe source: adapted from Rachel Ray and Glorious Treats","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"For the cookies","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add chocolate and butter to a medium microwave safe mixing bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"mixing-bowl.jpg"},{"id":404762,"name":"microwave","image":"microwave.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat in microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring well between intervals until melted and smooth, set aside to cool slightly.

Melt butter along with any gobbets of fat from the chicken’s cavity in a wide saucepan (one that has a lid). Process or finely chop the onion and garlic, and add to the pan with the butter, frying over a medium heat until the onion softens and begins to color.2. Discard bits of the rendered chicken, add the rice and chopped cherries, and give everything a good stir so that the rice becomes slicked with the fat. Add the water and a sprinkling of salt and bring to the boil, then clamp on the lid and cook at the lowest heat possible for 15 minutes. While the rice is cooking, preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).3. When the rice is ready, by which I mean all the water will be absorbed and the rice be more or less cooked, fork through the chopped parsley and season with salt and pepper.Make the roast chicken4. Spoon the cherry-studded rice into the cavities of both chickens, and secure the openings with two or three cocktail sticks. The easiest way to do this is to pinch together the flaps of skin from each side of the cavity and make a stitch to hold them with a cocktail stick.5. Rub the secured chickens with the butter and roast in the oven for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The skin should be golden and crispy and the meat cooked through; test by piercing the chickens between thigh and body and if juices run clear, the chicken’s ready. The reason why the chickens take longer than you would normally give them is twofold: in the first instance, the rice stuffing impedes the flow of hot air; in the second, roasting two chickens in the oven tends to make each take longer to brown.6.

Stir frequently allowing them to begin to toast (3-4 minutes) at which time you will be able to smell them toasting.Add the onion, turbinado sugar, rice vinegar, dry mustard, kosher salt, pepper, mango, and jalapeno to the saucepan; stir to fully combine and bring to a light simmer.  Immediately reduce the heat and allow the pan to hit on low heat for 3-4 minutes just to combine the flavors.Remove the pan from the heat and pour contents into a blender.
