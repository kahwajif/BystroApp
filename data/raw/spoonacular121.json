Styled to be fuller in body and structure than most of Jadots Mâconnais wines, it is partially fermented and aged in oak casks to add breadth to the ripe fruit notes.

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Fetzer Vineyards Valley Oaks Pinot Grigio.
