Make a well with walls that are about 1 inch thick, make sure the well is large enough to hold the eggs, milk and oil. Add the yolks, egg, milk and oil. Break the yolks. Using your fingers, stir quickly. The motion will allow the liquid to pick up flour from the walls and will gradually become thicker. This will take about 10 minutes. As the liquid becomes thicker, close to a paste consistency, start to push the flour walls up over and into the liquid pool. Continue to stir until the flour and liquid is mostly incorporated. Pull the dough into a ball, it will be shaggy and seem a bit dry. Knead on a flat surface with the heel of your hand, this will take a ten to fifteen minutes. Knead until the dough is smooth and slightly elastic. If you aren’t sure if the dough is done, keep kneading. This isn’t a dough that can be over worked, but too little kneading is a problem. Put dough into a small bowl and cover tightly and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cut into 4 sections. Place any dough sections you are not working with back in the bowl and cover. One at a time, roll out the dough sections to about ¼ to ½ inch rectangle. Attach the KitchenAid Pasta Roller attachment to your stand mixer. Set the thickness to 1 (the thickest setting). Turn the KitchenAid stand mixer to a speed of 2. Feed the dough rectangle into the pasta roller narrowest side first.Pass through two or three times. Narrow the thickness to a 3. Pass the dough sheet through two or three times, this should get easier and easier with each pass. Narrow the thickness to a 5. Pass the dough sheet through two or three times, this should get easier and easier with each pass. You want the dough sheets to be so thin you can see through them. Lay the sheets on a flat surface.Place about 2-3 tsp of goat cheese on the dough sheets about 1 ½ inches apart, in to rows. Brush the dough with water around the balls of goat cheese (sprinkle with fresh herbs, if desired). Top with second sheet of pasta. Press the pasta around the filling, sealing well. Use a sharp knife or a pastry wheel to cut into squares. Place on a plate, allow to sit for about 10 minutes. Cook in a pot of lightly salted boiling water until raviolis float and are cooked through. Drain, plate and top with sauce. Heat the oil in a cast iron skillet over medium high heat, cook the onions until soft about five minutes. Add the tomatoes, cook until soft and the skin has blistered. Add the garlic, cook for about 30 seconds. Add the beer and cook until the beer has mostly evaporated, about ten minutes. Add the remaining basil, oregano, salt and pepper, stir, remove from heat. Add to a food processor along with the tomato paste, process until smooth.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"On a flat surface add the flour.

Add brandy if using and mix until fully incorporated. Add half of the flour mixture and mix only until barely combined. Mix in sour cream. Mix in the rest of the flour until you have a thick cake batter with all flour combined. Spread the batter in the prepared pan. Top with sliced apricots in even rows. Try not to overlap. Place cherries on top, pressing some into the batter.Make the topping. In a medium bowl, stir together flour, sugars, cinnamon, and salt until fully incorporated with no big lumps. Add the butter. Stir until all of the dry mixture is moistened and clumps of various sizes are formed. Pour topping evenly over cake and fruit.Bake for 70 to 80 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the very center of the cake comes out with a few moist crumbs, rotating halfway through if necessary. Make sure the toothpick has crumbs, or the cake may still be liquid in the middle. It will be golden brown on top. Some of the crumbs will become very crunchy, if you do not want this to happen, cover the cake after about 60 minutes of baking. Cool in pan for at least 1 hour. Cut into 12 pieces and serve warm or at room temperature. Store for up to 2 days at room temperature or frozen, wrapped in parchment and foil and placed in a zipper bag for up to 3 months.

Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Tiamo Pinot Grigio.

The night before, rinse your rice with water until water runs clear. Soak rice in water overnight.2. In a bowl, combine soy sauce, sugar, five spice powder, shaoxing wine, and water. Add in pork belly and stir a few times until all pieces are covered in marinade. Marinade overnight in the fridge. I recommend stirring around the meat at the half-way point, so that the meat at the bottom doesn't become saltier and more marinated than the pieces on top.3. On the day of wrapping, first soak bamboo leaves in a a large container for about 30 minutes. This will wash off any dirt or dust and should make your leaves soft enough so that you can fold them to get them to fit into a large pot. Boil leaves in a large pot for about 10 minutes, or until all the leaves are pliable and look evenly wet and slightly more brown.4. Drain water from sticky rice. Lightly dry your leaves. Gather all your ingredients and place them onto your working surface. I also recommend you cut the twine ahead of time. I used3 1/2 feet per dumpling, but this length will vary depending on the size of your dumplings and how many times you need to wrap to secure. You may want to do a practice one to get the idea of the length you need, and then pre-cut the rest of the twine based on that length.5. For the rest of the wrapping steps, please refer to photos above fore more details. Choose two bamboo leaves that are approximately the same size. Snip off the hard ends. Place the leaves so that the shiny side faces down and the dull side faces up. Arrange the leaves so that the two pointy ends are facing each other. Then pushthe leaves inward, so that the leaves overlap halfway (basically the pointy edge of one leaf should be halfway up the legnth of the other leaf).6. Holding where the pointy ends are, fold inward on both sides until you form a cone with a pointy bottom. The excess portion of the leaves not in the conefrom both sides should be about the same length.7. Fill the bottom of your cone with some rice. Then add about 5 pieces of pork belly. I also liked drizzling a little of the excess marinade onto the rice. Add 4-5 peanuts and half an egg yolk. Then fill the top with more rice. You can fill up close to the edge of the top of the cone, but leave a little room. Pinch both sides of your cone (see photo), then take the top leaves and fold down and over. This should form a triangle. Take the excess leftoverleaves and fold around the triangle. It doesn't matter which side but I found there was always a side that needed a few more folds to help secure filling. Make sure all your fold are tight.8. Take your pre-cut twine and start wrapping around yoru dumpling to secure all the folds. I usually wrapped three times going one direction and then 2-3 times the other way. When you are done, double knot the string. Set aside and repeat with remaining dumplings.9. To cook, fill a large pot with water and put dumplings in. Boil for about 2 hours or until rice is tender. You can also steam, but it will take about 4 hours. Or you can use a multi-function pressure cooker and steam for about 35 minutes.You can store cooked zongzi in the freezer for several months. Just re-steam to eat.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"The night before, rinse your rice with water until water runs clear.

To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Chehalem INOX Chardonnay with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442371,"title":"Chehalem INOX Chardonnay","description":"INOX® takes its name from the abbreviation of the French word for stainless steel, inoxydable. The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.\n\nQuintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.
