Special equipment: 8 4-ounce ramekins              For the panna cotta: Heat the cream, vanilla extract and vanilla bean in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat until milk bubbles form at the sides of the pan, stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes.                          Meanwhile, in a small bowl dissolve the gelatin in 3 tablespoons hot tap water. Stir until the gelatin completely dissolves, about 1 minute.                          Stir the sugar into the hot cream. Add the salt and the gelatin mixture to the cream as well. Whisk until the sugar dissolves, then whisk in the milk and stir again. Pour into the ramekins.                          Refrigerate the panna cotta until set, at least 4 hours. Stored in the refrigerator, the panna cotta keeps for several days.                          For the berry sauce: In a medium saucepot set over medium heat, add the berries, sugar, lemon juice and zest. Bring to a boil and cook until the berries burst and the liquid starts to thicken, about 5 minutes. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve, forcing the berries through by pushing and scraping with a rubber spatula. The more you force through, the thicker the sauce will be (the pulp closest to the seeds contains the most pectin, which is a natural thickener).

for Mexican. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. One wine you could try is Bernardus Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir. It has 4.7 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 48 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":465202,"title":"Bernardus Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir","description":"The Santa Lucia Highlands are known as one of the premier Pinot Noir appellations of the world. One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                In a small bowl, combine the first six ingredients; set aside 2 tablespoons.

As much as it might seem that the Bundt pan was magically invented in the iconic American era known as \"The 50's\" - it wasn't. Well, sort've. The Bundt pan was trademarked in 1950 by H. David Dalquist, founder of Nordic Ware, based in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. The actual origins of a Bundt-style pan traces back to the other side of the world - Germany, Austria, and Hungary really. So what do you know, the infamous American Bundt Pan (like most of our ancestors) is an immigrant.Actually the Bundt Pan/Cake frenzy was very ahead of its time. Like those silly-tastic cake pops, foods in-a-jar and green smoothies - the trend of \"Bundt\" was a sign of the times - and occurred via some crafty marketing mixed with some serious 1950's word-of-mouth appeal. You can thank 1950's women for giving this trend legs. This was the era of the Tupperware Party. Bundt cakes were another hot trend floating around the neighborhood social circles. I keep picturing scenes from Pleasantville and The Help.I can just see it .. the \"ladies who lunch\" sipping tea and coffee in flowery pastel dresses, hair combed in rigid hair-sprayed outward loops - frosty pink lipstick on their excited mouths as they swapped Bundt cake recipes and bragged about how many slices of their signature Bundt recipe their husband's devoured after supper. Oh if only those ladies had Pinterest.But since social media was still a half century away, we have to thank big business for igniting the Bundt cake frenzy. The trend was sparked when Pillsbury sponsored a Bundt Cake Cookoff - also around that time, a pound cake (which everyone already knew and loved) was cooked in a Bundt pan and placed in the pages of the Good Housekeeping Cookbook. Boom. Bundt was born in American culture.(Bundt history via foodtimeline)And the Bundt trend continues. My post is proof of that.I must admit that there is something charming about a Bundt cake. The soft ridges in the cake, the signature doughnut shape, ideal for easy, uniform slicing. The appealing slim cake lines that allow glazed frosting to melt and curl over, swooping down in a shiny sugar puddle. So enough Bundt chatter ladies (and fellas - yay to how times have changed in the kitchen), lets pop a Bundt in the oven, steep some tea, brew some black coffee, lay out our best linen tablecloth and turn up the The Chordettes version of Mister Sandman ..

Briskly stir the flax seeds with the 1/2 cup water and set aside.5. Gently beat the wet ingredients - all except the flax mixture and apple cider vinegar.

You can adjust the basic ingredients to suit however thin or thick you like your glaze.

Always preheat for a good 5 to 10 minutes to let the temperature rise then even out. Spray a 9 x 13 pan with non stick spray generously. Set aside.In a large frying pan brown your ground beef. You want to cook it until the juices run clear and it's browning. But don't overcook it. Nothing worse than overcooked ground beef, it won't absorb sauces well like that. Make sure you stir it often and break it up into little pieces. Once the ground beef is cooked to perfection you can add both cans of the Manwich. Let it get to a nice bubble, then turn it down to a simmer. Open the first package of Pillsbury Garlic Crescent Rolls. Unroll it and place it in the bottom of the pan you set aside earlier. Spread it out with your hands till it fits the bottom really well. Now take half the mozzarella cheese (2 cups worth) and toss it on the dough evenly. Spread it out nicely.Turn off your burner for the Manwich. Carefully pour the Manwich mixture over top of the cheese. Spread it out with a spoon evenly. Now take your remaining mozzarella cheese (2 cups) and toss it evenly over the Manwich mixture. Spread it out nicely. Now open the second package of Pillsbury Garlic Crescent Rolls and unroll it. The top is trickier. Spread it out by hand in sections before placing on the top of the cheese. You could press it down on parchment if you're uneasy doing this, then just flip the parchment over and the dough will drop over the casserole perfectly. Honestly it doesn't have to be perfect. I left some gaps on the side and it looks sort of cool when you do that. You get to see the cheese get all bubbly. Place in the oven and cook for about 10 to 12 minutes, depending on your oven. You want the top to be golden brown. Remove from oven and place on a secure surface. Take a knife and cut the casserole into squares. Remove carefully while hot, the first piece is always the hardest. May the force be with you for that one.

Add in the cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and water then cover and cook on low for 6 hours, or until the apples are tender enough to fall apart with mashed with a fork. (If you're using a VitaClay, this process only takes 2 hours.)To make applesauce, use an immersion blender to puree the cooked apples. (If you chose to peel your apples, you can just use a fork or potato masher to break down the apples.) You could stop here, and enjoy this delicious spiced applesauce, but you'll need to keep cooking it down to create apple butter.Loosely cover the pot with the lid, leaving a vent for steam to escape, and set the slow cooker to cook for another 6 to 8 hours on low, or until the applesauce has reduced by nearly half. Alternatively, you could heat the applesauce on high 45 minutes, then reduce the heat to low to quicken the process, but be sure to not leave it on high too long, or you'll risk burning the apples on the bottom. (I cooked mine in the VitaClay for 45 minutes on the \"stew\" setting-- which is high heat-- then transferred the applesauce to a heavy bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat to finish the thickening process, stirring every few minutes to prevent burning.)Once the apple butter is nice and thick, transfer it to a glass jar and store it in the fridge for up to two weeks. (You can also freeze any extra for a longer shelf life!) Serve the apple butter over your favorite toast, pancakes, meats, salads, or simply enjoy it by the spoonful!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Core and chop the apples (I used this handy apple slicer to do it quickly) and place them in the bowl of your slow cooker.","ingredients":[{"id":9003,"name":"apple","image":"apple.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404718,"name":"slow cooker","image":"slow-cooker.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add in the cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and water then cover and cook on low for 6 hours, or until the apples are tender enough to fall apart with mashed with a fork.

Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Heat up olive oil in a stock pot.Add chicken breast and brown on both sides, 2 minutes or so.Remove the chicken onto a plate and set aside.Add diced veggies to the pot.
