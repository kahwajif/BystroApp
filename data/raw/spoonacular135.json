Roll up the chicken and seal with one or two toothpicks. Warm the olive oil and halved garlic clove in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat until the garlic is fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the chicken. Brown the chicken on all sides, about 3 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the pan and remove and discard the garlic. Add the wine and simmer for 2 minutes while scraping up the brown bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Meanwhile, combine the tomatoes and red pepper flakes in a blender and blend until smooth. Add the tomato mixture to the reduced wine in the pan. Simmer for 5 minutes to let the flavors marry.

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio.

In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, gram flour, if using, yeast, and sugar and mix well. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour the oil, almost all of the water, and the food coloring, if using, into the well and stir until no lumps remain. The texture should be slightly runny, like pancake batter. (This is also known as “ribbon consistency,” which simply means that when the batter drips from a spoon, it falls like a ribbon onto the batter that remains in the bowl.) If necessary, add a touch more water. Let the batter rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.Make the syrup2. Place all the syrup ingredients in a small saucepan and bring to a gentle boil. Cook until the sugar dissolves and the mixture thickens slightly, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting to keep the syrup warm while you fry the jalebi. Fry the jalebi3. Place a wire rack over a baking sheet or grab a brown paper bag and place it on your work surface. Pour enough oil into a skillet or a deep-sided pot to reach a depth of about 1 1/2 inches and heat over medium-high heat. The oil is ready when you drop a tiny amount of batter into the oil and it immediately sizzles and resurfaces without changing color. (If the batter colors straight away, the oil is too hot. For those of you who crave certainty, attach a candy or deep-fry thermometer to the side of the pot and heat until the oil registers about 350°F (176°C).)4. Pour the rested jalebi batter into a piping bag, a plastic squeeze bottle with a pointed nozzle, or a large resealable plastic bag whose lower corner you snipped off with scissors. (We find a plastic squeeze bottle to offer the most control and ease in creating your jalebi squiggles.)5. Squeeze some of the jalebi batter into the oil in a squiggly coiled circle or flowerlike shape approximately 2 inches in diameter. Repeat 2 or 3 times to create just enough jalebi so as not to crowd the pan. Fry the jalebi until they’re the color of golden honey on both sides. Using a slotted spoon or tongs, gently transfer the jalebis to the pan of warm syrup. Let soak, turning at least once or twice, for no more than 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the jalebis to the wire rack or brown paper bag. Serve immediately or let cool completely and rewarm in a low oven or in the microwave.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the jalebi","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, gram flour, if using, yeast, and sugar and mix well.

Make sure the bowl is very large because the milk will bubble up and over if it is not big enough.Microwave the milk for 12 minutes, taking out and stirring at 3 minute intervals(will be very hot!).Stir in the evaporated milk, heavy cream, and vanilla.Set aside.For the cupcakes:Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.Line 2 cupcake tins with cupcake liners. Large, 1 C. liners work best, but regular will work as well. If using regular liners, you will need about 24. If using large, 1 C. liners, you will need 16.In a mixing bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon.Place the butter and whole milk in a saucepan and heat on medium until the butter has completely melted. Set aside.In a large mixing bowl, beat together the eggs. Add the sugar and beat together until glossy and pale yellow, about 5 minutes.Add in half of the flour mixture and mix in. Add in half of the milk/butter mixture and mix in. Mix in the remaining flour mixture and then the remaining milk mixture, mixing until just combined.Divide the batter between the cupcake liners, making sure to keep them under half full. If they are filled more than half full, the batter will overflow when cooked.Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes(longer for larger cupcakes) or until the tops are set and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cupcake comes out clean.Let the cupcakes cool for a few minutes, then poke a large amount of holes in each cupcake, using a wooden skewer. The more holes you poke, the more milk will be able to soak in.Pour a few Tablespoons of milk mixture over each cupcake, letting each spoonful soak in before adding more and dividing the milk mixture evenly between the cupcakes.Refrigerate the cupcakes and allow the milk to really soak into the cupcake, at least 3 hours.To Top The Cupcakes:Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Spread the coconut in an even layer over a baking sheet.Place the baking sheet on the top rack of the oven and watch VERY closely. The coconut will brown quickly. If you notice it browning some areas of the coconut more heavily than other areas, remove from the oven and stir the coconut and shake and tap it to spread it out evenly again. Place back in the oven and continue toasting.When most of the coconut is a light brown, remove from oven and allow to cool.Place the heavy cream and 1/4 C. Sugar in a mixing bowl and beat on high speed until stiff peaks form. Place whipped cream in a piping bag and pipe a swirling of cream on top of each chilled cupcake.Coat the sides of the whipped cream with toasted coconut and top with a maraschino cherry.Serve Chilled.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the Milk","ingredients":[{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"milk.png"}],"equipment":[]}]},{"name":"Mixture","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pour the Sweetened Condensed Milk into a very large, microwave safe bowl.

Whisk in the remaining sauce ingredients. Set aside.Make the noodles:Fill a large pot with hot water. Add the rice noodles and cover the pot, allowing them to soak and soften for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they're barely al dente. (Alternately, cook the noodles according to the package instructions.) The noodles will be stir-fried so do not overcook them at this point.Drain the noodles and rinse them with cold water to prevent them from sticking together. Cut the chicken breasts into thin, 1-inch slices. Place the chicken in a medium bowl. Whisk together the cornstarch with the soy sauce then pour it over the chicken, stirring to coat.Heat a wok or large nonstick saut pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil then add the minced garlic and crushed red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously, for 30 seconds until the garlic is golden brown and fragrant. Add the chicken to the pan (including all liquids), and cook, stirring frequently until it is no longer pink. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of chicken stock at a time to the pan while the chicken is cooking to prevent it from drying out. (You may not use the entire 1/4 cup of chicken stock.)Add the noodles to the pan then pour in the prepared sauce. Bring the sauce to a boil, and using two flat spatulas, lift and turn the noodles to combine all of the ingredients. (Don't stir the noodles too vigorously or they'll break.) Continue cooking the noodles for 1 to 2 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly, then add the bean sprouts and cook for 1 more minute. The noodles are fully cooked when they are chewy and no longer crunchy.Transfer the noodles to serving dishes and garnish with the sliced carrots, shredded red cabbage, cilantro, scallions, peanuts and lime wedges.Kelly's Notes:A majority of the specialty ingredients in this recipe can be found in the Asian aisle of most supermarkets. My preferred brand of rice noodles is Annie Chun's Pad Thai Noodles.It's important to bring the sauce to a boil so that it will thicken enough as it cooks with the noodles.Make sure you have all of your ingredients prepped and ready to go before you start cooking. This is a fast recipe that comes together in less than 10 minutes once the garlic hits the pan.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the sauce:In a medium bowl, whisk together the tamarind concentrate with 1/2 cup warm water.","ingredients":[{"id":9322,"name":"tamarind paste","image":"tamarind.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Whisk in the remaining sauce ingredients.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line pans with cupcake liners.2. Take your 24 ores and twist them apart.  (If you are lucky, one side will have all the cream and the other side will be bare.)  Take the Oreo halves with the cream and place them cream side up at the bottom of each cupcake liner.  3. Sift cake mix into a small bowl to remove lumps and set aside.4. In a large bowl, gently whisk eggs, oil, buttermilk, sour cream and vanilla extract together.5. Add cake mix and stir until smooth.6.  Fill cupcake liners (over your Oreo halves) 3/4 full and bake for 15-20 minutes or until an inserted knife comes out clean. 7.  Filling: Beat cream cheese and butter until smooth.  Slowly add powdered sugar until you reach your desired consistency. To prepare your Oreos for the filling, take the \"bare\" halves left over from the cake and crush them finely.  Then put them through a sifter to remove the larger pieces.  Add 1/3 cup of this Oreo \"powder\" to your filling and stir.8.  After cupcakes have cooled, use a knife to cut \"cones\" out of the top of each cupcake, deep enough to fill with your filling.  Use a spoon or a piping bag to fill the holes in the cupcakes with your Oreo filling.  Cut off the pointy part of your \"cone\" removed from the cake, and place the top back over the filling.  (See my Homemade Hostess post for images on filling the cakes.) 9. Ganache: Place chocolate, honey and vanilla extract in a heat proof bowl.  Heat heavy cream on the stove top just until small bubbles start to form around the edges.  Pour cream over your chocolate and whisk until smooth.  You may need to let it cool for a few minutes to let it thicken.10.

It should be just thick enough that it coats very easily to vada.Now potato mixture should be cool to touch. Divide it into 8 equal portions and shape them into round, smooth ball. And meanwhile heat the oil in pan for deep frying.Now deep one potato ball in the batter and coat with batter from all the sides.Once oil is hot drop batter coated ball into the oil very carefully. Oil should be hot enough (more hot then usual all frying). How to check oil is hot enough or not? Drop small portion of batter into oil and if it comes on top of oil immediately then oil is ready for frying. If oil is not hot enough then vada will break into the oil or it can absorb more oil.Deep fry it till it is golden brown from all the sides. do not touch the vada for at least 1 minute after adding in the oil. If you touch with your spatula then it might get break.Remove it to the paper towel lined plate. And serve warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat the oil in a pan on medium heat. Once hot add cumin seeds and let them sizzle.Then add chopped green chilie.

In a medium microwave-safe bowl, melt the baking chocolate on high power for about 1 minute, stir, and continue to melt in 30 second increments until fully melted and can be stirred smooth; set aside.   In a small bowl, whisk the eggs and vanilla; set aside. To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat the butter until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute.  Add the sugars and beat to incorporate and mixture is unform, 1 to 2 minutes, noting the mixture will be granular.  Add the egg-vanilla mixture and beat until incorporated, about 1 minute.  Add the melted baking chocolate and beat until combined, about 1 minute. Add the sifted dry ingredients and beat to just incorporate them, about 1 minute. Do not overmix batter at any point in the process.   Add the semi-sweet chocolate chips, chopped truffles (or chopped candy bar pieces; chopped to the size of a chocolate chip or just slightly larger) and the chopped Oreo cookies and beat for 10 seconds to just incorporate or fold in by hand (I used chocolate-filled Oreos because I wanted all-chocolate, no white in the dough, but traditional white-filled Oreos may be used; chocolate graham crackers may also be substituted. The Oreos and their resulting crumbs help soak up some of the moisture from the batter and if not using them you may consider increasing the flour by 1 to 2 tablespoons as well as adding slightly more semi-sweet chocolate chips or truffles/candy based on how your batter looks). Chill dough for at least 30 minutes and up to 5 days before baking. Note that unbaked cookie dough can be formed into balls and stored in an airtight container or ziplock in the freezer for up to 3 months and baked straight from freezer to oven, extending baking time by a minute or two if necessary; this is nice so you don't have to bake all of them at once as they are rich. Preheat oven to 350 F and line two baking trays with Silpat Non-Stick Baking Mats or spray with cooking spray, set aside. If necessary, allow dough to come to room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes and scoop out 2.25 ounces of dough, weighed on a scale (approximately a scant 1/4-cup measure or a heaping 2-inch cookie scoop) and place mounds on a baking tray, spaced about 2 inches apart. I bake 8 to a tray, maximum. Bake for about 10 minutes, or until the tops have just set, even though the centers will seem soft or slightly underbaked, as the cookies will set up quite dramatically as they cool. If the cookies stayed domed and mounded while baking (mine did), tap the top of each mound lightly yet firmly with the back of a spoon or push down very gently with the bottom of a glass to flatten them. If after flattening they seem very soft, return to the oven for 1 to 2 more minutes (mine were soft to the point of raw after flattening so I returned to the oven for 90 seconds; total baking time was 11 minutes). Allow cookies to cool on baking sheets for at least 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Cookies will keep in an airtight container for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.

For each artichoke, snap off the bottom stem and then trim the tough leaves at the base and the tops of the leaves at the artichoke's tip, roughly one-third. Remove the rest of the leaves carefully until you reach the choke, a dome of inedible fibers that protect the artichoke heart. Scrape it out with a melon baller or a spoon, taking care not to damage the heart underneath. Place the heart in the bowl of lemon water to prevent it from browning while you work on the rest of the artichokes.Bring salted water (enough to cover the artichoke hearts) to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add the artichoke hearts, bring back to a boil and cook for eight minutes. Drain and let cool.Place the artichoke hearts, the fresh goat cheese and two teaspoons of olive oil in a food processor and pulse until combined but still slightly chunky. (This can also be done by hand with a fork.) Cover and refrigerate until ready to assemble.Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

Use the paper rectangle as a guide to cut out 12 equal pastry rectangles with a sharp knife.Transfer the pastry rectangles onto the cookie sheet, leaving them a little room to expand. Prick the rectangles with the tines of a fork (to prevent the dough from rising too much as it bakes), brush the rectangles with olive oil, and sprinkle lightly with thyme and fleur de sel. Put into the oven to bake for 10-12 minutes, until puffy and golden. Turn out on a rack to cool.Put two rectangles of pastry on a work surface. Spread each of them with a rounded tablespoon of filling, working carefully so as not to break or damage the pastry. Put them one on top of the other, top with a third rectangle and set aside.
