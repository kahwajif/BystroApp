Heat over medium heat until the mixture thickens and reaches a simmer, stirring fairly often. When the mixture starts to simmer and turns translucent, whisk in the egg yolks, one at a time. Then whisk in the zest, then the lemon juice, and then the butter. Bring the mixture to a good simmer, whisking constantly. Remove from the heat. Place a sheet of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the filling to keep it hot and prevent a skin from forming.In a small saucepan, whisk together the cornstarch and water until combined. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, whisking occasionally at the beginning and more frequently as the mixture thickens. Once the mixture starts to simmer and turns translucent, remove from heat and set aside.Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 325 degrees. In a small bowl, whisk the cream of tartar and sugar together. In the bowl of a large stand mixer, beat the egg whites and vanilla for 1-2 minutes on medium-high speed until frothy. Beat in the sugar mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the sugar is completely incorporated. Continue beating on medium speed until the mixture forms soft peaks. (*Look ahead to multitask the next step with the lemon filling at this point.) Add the cornstarch mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, while the mixture is still beating. Continue to beat on medium speed until the mixture forms stiff peaks, about 1-2 minutes. *When you are about a minute away from finishing the meringue, remove the plastic from the lemon filling and return the saucepan to medium heat. Let it heat for at least 1 minute so that it is nice and hot when you add it to the pie shell.Once your meringue is ready and the filling is hot, pour the filling into the prebaked pie shell and use a rubber spatula to even out the top. Use a spoon to immediately add small spoonfuls of the meringue all around the edge of the filling, and then add spoonfuls to the center until the entire surface of the filling is covered. Make sure the meringue attaches to the piecrust to prevent shrinking. Use the back of a spoon to create little decorative peaks all over the meringue, or whatever design you would like. Bake the pie until the meringue is lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool to room temperature. Serve the same day.*Be sure that the eggs you use to make the meringue are fresh. Otherwise, they may not whip up properly.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Whisk the sugar, cornstarch, salt and water in a large (nonreactive) saucepan.","ingredients":[{"id":20027,"name":"corn starch","image":"white-powder.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"},{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat over medium heat until the mixture thickens and reaches a simmer, stirring fairly often.

Beat egg yolks, remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons whole cane sugar, and vanilla until thick (about 45 seconds). Whisk in arrowroot until smooth. Slowly pour hot milk over yolks, whisking constantly to avoid clumping. Pour milk/egg mixture into a medium saucepan and heat over medium, whisking constantly until thick, about 3-5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cover surface with parchment paper to prevent a skin from forming. Chill for at least 1 hour.Whip egg whites until foamy and then slowly add maple syrup.

Remove the chicken from the cooking liquid and allow it to cool; reserve the cooking liquid. The chicken should be about almost but not completely cooked.2. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the bones and cut it into bite-size strips along the grain of the meat. (The bones and scrappy pieces of meat can be returned to the cooking liquid and made into stock. And I never discard the skin.)3. Cut the fresh chile in half lengthwise and discard the seeds and pithy part, then cut into very fine slivers about 1 1/2 inches long. Peel the remaining ginger and cut it into slices and then slivers similar to the chile. Cut the green parts of the remaining 2 scallions into slivers of a similar length; set aside.4. Heat the wok over a high flame until smoke rises, then add the lard or peanut oil and swirl around. When the oil is warming up but before it’s smoking hot, add the fresh chile and ginger along with the dried chiles and Sichuan pepper, if using, and stir-fry until fragrant, taking care that the seasonings do not take color or burn.5. Add the chicken and continue to stir-fry. Carefully splash the Shaoxing wine around the chicken. Add the vinegar, Sichuan pepper oil, if using, and salt to taste. Add up to 1 cup chicken poaching liquid (if the chicken is very juicy, no additional liquid will be necessary), bring to a boil, and then turn the heat down a little and simmer briefly to allow the flavors to penetrate the chicken, occasionally spooning the liquid over the chicken.6. Add the potato flour mixture to the liquid and stir as the sauce thickens. Throw in the scallion greens and stir a few times. Remove from the heat and stir in the sesame oil. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Bring the water or stock to the boil in a large saucepan over a high flame.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the chicken and return the liquid to the boil, skimming the surface, as necessary.

You can also use pureed tomatoes and skip the step where the diced tomatoes are blended into a puree.","ingredients":[{"id":11135,"name":"cauliflower","image":"cauliflower.jpg"},{"id":20420,"name":"pasta","image":"fusilli.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]}]},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":9,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"preparationMinutes":15,"cookingMinutes":105,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/baked-rice-pudding-with-apricots-recipe.html","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/baked-rice-pudding-with-apricots-734487","aggregateLikes":32,"spoonacularScore":48,"healthScore":6,"creditsText":"Foodnetwork","sourceName":"Foodnetwork","pricePerServing":55.39,"extendedIngredients":[{"id":9021,"aisle":"Produce","image":"apricot.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"apricots","original":"1/4 cup diced dried apricots","originalString":"1/4 cup diced dried apricots","originalName":"diced dried apricots","amount":0.25,"unit":"cup","meta":["dried","diced"],"metaInformation":["dried","diced"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":0.25,"unitShort":"cups","unitLong":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":59.147,"unitShort":"ml","unitLong":"milliliters"}}},{"id":1125,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"egg-yolk.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"egg yolks","original":"4 egg yolks","originalString":"4 egg yolks","originalName":"egg yolks","amount":4,"unit":"","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":4,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""},"metric":{"amount":4,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""}}},{"id":9156,"aisle":"Produce","image":"zest-lemon.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"lemon zest","original":"1/2 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest","originalString":"1/2 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest","originalName":"freshly grated lemon zest","amount":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon","meta":["freshly grated"],"metaInformation":["freshly grated"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":0.5,"unitShort":"tsps","unitLong":"teaspoons"},"metric":{"amount":0.5,"unitShort":"tsps","unitLong":"teaspoons"}}},{"id":1077,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"milk.png","consitency":"liquid","name":"milk","original":"4 cups milk","originalString":"4 cups milk","originalName":"milk","amount":4,"unit":"cups","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":4,"unitShort":"cups","unitLong":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":946.352,"unitShort":"ml","unitLong":"milliliters"}}},{"id":10120052,"aisle":"Pasta and Rice","image":"uncooked-white-rice.png","consitency":"solid","name":"short grain rice","original":"3/4 cup raw short-grain rice (such as Arborio), rinsed in a colander until the water runs clear","originalString":"3/4 cup raw short-grain rice (such as Arborio), rinsed in a colander until the water runs clear","originalName":"raw short-grain rice (such as Arborio), rinsed in a colander until the water runs clear","amount":0.75,"unit":"cup","meta":["raw","rinsed","(such as Arborio)"],"metaInformation":["raw","rinsed","(such as Arborio)"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":0.75,"unitShort":"cups","unitLong":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":177.441,"unitShort":"ml","unitLong":"milliliters"}}},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png","consitency":"solid","name":"sugar","original":"1/2 cup sugar","originalString":"1/2 cup sugar","originalName":"sugar","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":0.5,"unitShort":"cups","unitLong":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":118.294,"unitShort":"ml","unitLong":"milliliters"}}},{"id":93622,"aisle":"Baking","image":"vanilla.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"vanilla bean","original":"1/4 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and scraped","originalString":"1/4 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and scraped","originalName":"vanilla bean, split lengthwise and scraped","amount":0.25,"unit":"","meta":["split"],"metaInformation":["split"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":0.25,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""},"metric":{"amount":0.25,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""}}}],"id":734487,"title":"Baked Rice Pudding with Apricots","readyInMinutes":120,"servings":8,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/734487-556x370.jpeg","imageType":"jpeg","cuisines":[],"dishTypes":["side dish"],"diets":["gluten free","lacto ovo vegetarian"],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.

To Make the Pâte Brisée: In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour and salt; pulse to combine. Add the butter, and pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some larger pieces remaining, about 10 seconds. (To mix by hand, combine dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl, then cut in butter with a pastry blender.)2. With the machine running, add the ice water through the feed tube in a slow, steady stream, just until the dough holds together without being wet or sticky. Do not process more than 30 seconds. Test by squeezing a small amount of the dough together; if it is still too crumbly, add a bit more water, 1 tablespoon at a time.3. Turn out the dough onto a clean work surface. Divide in half, and place each half on a piece of plastic wrap. Shape into flattened disks. Wrap in plastic, and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight. The dough can be frozen for up to 1 month; thaw overnight in the refrigerator before using.4. To Make the Pie: Fold 1 dough round in half and carefully transfer to a 9-inch pie dish. Unfold and ease the round into the pan, without stretching it, and pat it firmly into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Using kitchen scissors, trim the edge of the dough, leaving ¾ inch of overhang. Set the dough-lined pan, along with the other dough round, in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.2. Place the blueberries in a large bowl, sprinkle with the lemon juice and toss to coat evenly. In a small bowl, stir together the sugar, cornstarch, lemon zest, salt and cinnamon. Sprinkle the sugar mixture over the berries and toss to distribute evenly. Immediately transfer to the dough-lined pan. Dot with the butter.3. Fold the reserved dough round in half and carefully position it over half of the filled pie. Unfold and trim the edge neatly, leaving 1 inch of overhang, then fold the edge of the top round under the edge of the bottom round and crimp the edges to seal. Using a small, sharp knife, cut an asterisk 4 to 5 inches across in the center of the top to allow steam to escape during baking.4. Refrigerate the pie until the dough is firm, 20 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, position a rack in the lower third of an oven and preheat to 375°F.5. Brush on the egg wash over the surface of the pie, if desired. Bake the pie until the crust is golden and the filling is thick and bubbling, 50 to 60 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely to set, 1 to 2 hours. Serve at room temperature or rewarm in a 350°F oven for 10 to 15 minutes just before serving. Makes one 9-inch pie; serves 8.Note: If fresh blueberries are unavailable, use frozen blueberries (without thawing them first) and increase the baking time by 10 to 15 minutes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To Make the Pâte Brisée: In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour and salt; pulse to combine.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"food-processor.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the butter, and pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some larger pieces remaining, about 10 seconds.

Once the peach is cool enough to handle, slip the skin off. I've also found that the ease of removing peach skins really depends on the ripeness of the fruit and how it's been grown. If the peach is overripe or underripe, it always seems like it's much harder (sometimes impossible) to remove the skins. In that case, I just cut the skin away.Cut and mix: Add a little sugar into the bottom of a medium-sized glass (or non-metal, non-reactive) bowl. Slice each peach in half, top to bottom, and remove the pit. Cut each half into 12-16 thin slices and add to the bowl. Between each peach, add a little more sugar until you've added all the peaches and all the sugar. Then add the wine and the chiles and stir gently until combined.Macerate (2-3 days): Let the mixture sit in the fridge for at least two days (and up to three). If you want a little extra kick, try this: on the second day, simmer the mixture again, allow to cool, and transfer back to the bowl and let it sit in the fridge for one more day. (This will infuse more spice into your jam).Cook: (If you're canning, start preparing your boiling water bath, jars, and lids now). Pour the peach mixture into a colander suspended over a bowl and strain the juices. Transfer the juices to a preserving pan or a heavy-bottomed, wide, deep, non-reactive, uncoated sauté pan. Add the lemon juice to the pan. Cut the apples into quarters and either add straight to the pan or bundle in a cheesecloth and add to the pan. (You can substitute the apples with homemade or commercial pectin, if you'd prefer.) Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Continue to boil, stirring from time to time, until the liquid is bubbling thickly and reduced, about 15-20 minutes. Remove the apples and discard or save for another use. Add the peach slices, lemon zest, and any accumulated juices to the syrup in the pan. Bring to a simmer and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture is bubbling thickly and the foam subsides, about 15-20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir gently for a few seconds to distribute the fruit.Can: (optional) Fill your hot, sterile jars to ¼\" headspace, remove any air bubbles, wipe the rims, put your lids on, and process for 10 minutes in the boiling water bath.Store: Refrigerated, the preserves will keep up to 1 month.

Slowly whisk in some of the warm cream mixture, 1/3 cup at a time, until about half of the cream mixture has been incorporated and yolk mixture is warm to the touch. You want to do this gradually; doing so will temper the egg yolks rather than cook them.Pour yolk mixture back into the saucepan and return to medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens slightly and coats the back of a spatula, about 5 to 7 minutes, or until it reaches approximately 165 to 170ºF.

honey and oil. Shake until thoroughly combined.\n Wash and prep the poblanos for roasting (link above). While the poblanos are roasting, prep the veggies.\nIn a large, 12-inch cast iron skillet, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Once hot, add in all the corn kernels in an even layer. Toast in the skillet until charred, about 2 minutes before tossing the corn and repeating for an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until nicely charred. Transfer to a large bowl and set off to the side. \nAdd  2 more teaspoons of olive oil to the skillet and reduce the heat to medium. Add in the spiralized sweet potatoes and toss in the oil to coat.

If you don’t quarter the breast, you’ll end up with large underdone pieces.The chicken should be put in a dish and covered with a little water or milk, which will help keep the flour on (I used milk). Let the chicken stand at room temperature – it is a bad idea to put cold chicken into hot oil!Put the flour in a deep, wide bowl and season with salt, pepper, and optional smoked paprika and cayenne. Laurie recommends paprika because she adores paprika and feels it gives the chicken a smoky taste and beautiful color.Mix the chickpea flour, quinoa flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, salt, pepper, paprika, and cayenne in a bowl. Mix well and then sift together to make sure everything is completely distributed.Now, coat the chicken with the flour. To do this, lay a few pieces of chicken in the bowl and “pack the flour on a if you were a child making sand pies. Any excess flour should be packed between the layers. It’s important to make sure that every inch of chicken has a nice thick cover.”Let the chicken sit while you work with the frying oil. Laurie says that many folks recommend frying chicken in Crisco, but she prefers Wesson oil with about one-quarter part light sesame oil mixed in, which gives the chicken “a wonderful taste and is worth the extra expense.” For me, I used rice bran oil with light sesame oil mixed in, and it worked fabulously.The oil should come up to just under the halfway mark on your chicken fryer – say, about 1 to 1-1/2 inches deep. Over a medium flame, heat the oil to 360°F (or until a piece of bread on a skewer fries as soon as you dip it on).Carefully slip into the oil as many pieces as will fit in the pan. Laurie says that the rule is to crowd the pan a bit. Turn the heat down to medium-low and cover the pan. She says, “the idea of covering frying chicken makes many people squeal, but it is the only correct method. It gets the chicken cooked through.” Ed. note: don’t mess with your chicken while it’s cooking. Poking and prodding will knock off your coating… so just let it alone!The chicken must be just done to that it is crispy but still juicy. She recommends about six minutes per side, turning only once. Dark meat will take a little longer, and use a sharp form to test the chicken to see if it’s done – when the chicken just slips off the fork, it is done inside.Take off the lid and turn up the heat to medium-high. Fry the chicken until it is “the color of Colonial pine stain – a dark honey color.”Remove the chicken from the oil and set it on a platter, then put the platter in the oven. If your oven has a gas pilot light, that should be enough heat. If you have an electric oven, flip it on ahead of time to the lowest setting and turn it off after two minutes. Let the chicken sit until it has cooled to a warm temperature. She doesn’t specify how long, though I let mine sit for at least half an hour.At this point, she says “You have now made the perfect fried chicken,” and that every time you make this recipe it will get even better.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Chicken pieces should be roughly the same size – this means that you should cut breasts into quarters.

Butter two 9-inch round cake pans then line bottom of each with a round of parchment paper. Butter parchment paper and set aside.In a large, heat proof mixing bowl, whisk together granulated sugar and brown sugar (lumps are fine), then whisk in cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Carefully pour boiling water in to cocoa mixture and immediately whisk to blend well, about 15 - 20 seconds. Allow to cool 5 minutes.Using an electric hand mixer set on low speed blend in canola oil until combined, about 10 seconds. Add eggs to cocoa mixture and blend on low speed just until combined, about 5 seconds. Add egg yolks and vanilla extract and blend just to combined. Then add flour and blend only until combined and finish by blending in milk and sour cream just until combined. Divide mixture evenly among 2 prepared pans. Bake in preheated oven until toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs, about 29 - 34 minutes. Allow to cool in pan 5 minutes, run butter knife around edge of cake and invert onto a wire rack and allow to cool completely (after about 20 minutes of cooling, I placed the cakes into an airtight container to seal in moisture while they finished cooling). Trim tops from cake to form an even layer (they are quite domed so you don't need to make it completely level across - just add a little more frosting to the edges that aren't as level so you don't have to cut off so much cake). Add frosting to top of one round then top with second cake and frost top and sides of cake. Store in an airtight container.For the chocolate buttercream frosting:In a the bowl of an electric stand mixer, fitted with whisk attachment (paddle attachment works too. Whichever you use just pay attention the the shade of the butter), whip butter on moderately high speed until very pale and fluffy (nearly white in color), about 6 - 8 minutes, occasionally scraping down sides of the bowl. Sift in cocoa powder then add in powdered sugar, 3 Tbsp heavy cream and vanilla and mix on low speed until combine, scrapping down the sides of the bowl as needed and adding up to 1 tbsp additional cream to thin if desired. Increase mixer to medium-high speed and whip mixture until pale and very fluffy about 4 - 5 minutes, occasionally scraping down sides of the bowl.Note that similar to whipped cream the frosting will lose some of its \"fluff\" after a few hours, it will still taste the same it just loses some of the air that was whipped into it (similar to whipped cream how it loses it's stabilization after a few hours). It is best to prepare and use within a few hours for best (fluffiest) results.Recipe Source: Cooking Classy","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the cake:Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Line baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Cut in the chilled butter using a pastry blender (or two forks or your fingers) until the flour mixture resembles crumbly, course sand. Cut in the shortening. Pour in the cold buttermilk. Use a sturdy rubber spatula to fold the mixture together until a dough forms. The dough will look sticky. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Lightly dust your hands with flour. Knead the dough together until almost smooth. Pat the dough until 1-inch in thickness. Use a 3-inch round cutter to punch biscuits. Gather any remaining dough and knead together to cut more biscuits. You will end up with 4 biscuits. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes until the biscuits are golden brown on top. While the biscuits are baking, prepare the sausage gravy. Place a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage meat. Using a spatula, break the sausage into small pieces. Cook for about 5 minutes until the sausage has browned and there are no longer any bits of pink. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the flour and stir to combine. Keep stirring until the meat has absorbed the flour and there are no longer any dry streaks of flour. Slowly add the milk. Bring the mixture to a simmer to thicken the gravy. Cook for about 5 minutes. If the gravy is too thick, add the milk 1 tablespoon at a time until desired consistency is achieved. Taste the gravy and season with salt and pepper, as needed. Slice warm biscuits in half and place in a serving plate. Ladle hot sausage gravy over biscuits.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 400F.
