Continually stir until melted. You do not want to over heat it, just until the chocolate is melted completely and everything is well combined. Immediately remove from the burner and carefully pour into the large bowl over the water bath. Grab the biggest whisk you got, and get to whisking until the mixture has thickened. Keep whisking....and more whisking...and more whisking. Think your arm is going to fall off? Good. That means you are getting close. You will know when the mixture has thickened, you can just feel and see it. It will look like chocolate pudding. Be careful not to over whisk. You will know you have over-whisked if it takes on a grainy consistency. If that happens, just reheat the chocolate and then start again. But if you watch closely you should not have a problem. Divide mousse among 4 different glasses, cover with saran wrap and refrigerate for 12 hours. Apparently you can refrigerate it for less, but trust me...it's better to wait.

Add diced red bell pepper and cook, stirring for a couple of minutes until softened. Add chopped mushrooms and cook for another minute. Lower the heat to medium-low and add whisked eggs to the veggies. Cook, moving the eggs around with a wooden spoon until eggs are set up. Season to taste with salt and pepper and toss in the cilantro (if using). Remove pan from heat and add cooked, crumbled sausage and shredded cheese. Stir to combine and set aside.Warm the entire stack of tortillas in the microwave for about 20 seconds just to soften them slightly. Lay a tortilla on a cutting board or other work surface and place a couple tablespoons of the egg and sausage filling down the center of the tortilla. Sprinkle with some of the cheese. Roll the tortilla tightly and place seam side down on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Coat the tops of the taquitos with additional non-stick cooking spray.Bake at 400 degrees for 8  minutes. Pull baking sheet out of the oven and use tongs to flip each taquito over to brown the other side. Return to the oven for an additional 3 minutes or till nicely browned on both sides. Add 1/2 cup roughly chopped fresh baby spinach with, or instead of cilantro, and cook until spinach is wilted. Proceed as directed.You can add or substitute a variety of different veggies like zucchini, summer squash, asparagus, tomatoes. Anything you like in an omelet would be great here. Try it with different cheeses like jack, Swiss, Gouda, or goat cheese.Place on a baking sheet, leaving space around each taquito, and place baking sheet in the freezer for at least 2 hours or more until thoroughly frozen.

measuring cup. Add butter and microwave on high, until the mixture is warmed to the temperature directed by the yeast manufacturer (120F to 130F for Red Star Platinum Yeast). Start with 30 seconds, then microwave in 10-second intervals, until the desired temperature is reached. The butter may not melt completely and the water should feel warm but not hot. Once heated, pour into the bowl of standing mixer fitted with paddle attachment or a large mixing bowl.Add white whole wheat flour, granulated sugar, egg, vanilla, yeast, and salt. Beat on low speed for 3 minutes, stopping occasionally to scrape down sides of bowl. Add 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour. Beat on low speed, until the flour is absorbed and the dough is sticky, scraping down sides of bowl as you go. If dough is extremely sticky, add remaining flour one tablespoon at a time, combining after each, just until dough begins to form a shaggy ball and pulls away from sides of bowl. It should still feel fairly tacky.If using a stand mixer, fit the mixer with a dough hook and knead on medium low for 6 minutes, until smooth and elastic. If kneading by hand, turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Add a little flour, one tablespoon at a time, if the dough is too sticky and clings readily to your hands. Lightly oil a large, clean bowl with cooking spray. Form dough into a ball and place it in the bowl, turning once to coat with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. Let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.Meanwhile, make the peanut butter filling: In a small bowl, beat together the peanut butter, melted butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and cinnamon. Set aside.Form the rolls: Once the dough has doubled, turn it out onto a well-floured work surface. (To test if the dough has completed rising, gently press it with your first two fingers; if the indentation remains, the dough is ready.) Roll the dough into a 16-inch x 12-inch rectangle (be sure to measure.) Spread the peanut butter mixture over the dough, leaving a 1/4-inch border uncovered on all sides. Spread with jelly, leaving a 1/4-inch border of peanut butter uncovered on all sides.Starting at one of the long edges, roll the dough into a tight log, then tightly pinch the end to seal. Turn log so that the seam side is down, then carefully trim each end so that they are straight. (The end scraps can be baked separately in lightly greased ramekins.) Gently stretch and pat the dough log as needed so that it is 18 inches in length and roughly even in diameter. With a serrated knife, gently saw the log into 18, 1-inch segments.Lightly mist two 9 x 9-inch baking pans with cooking spray (square 8 x 8-inch pans or round 9-inch pans will work as well.) Arrange the rolls in the pans, cut sides up, dividing the rolls evenly between each. Cover the baking dishes with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes. (It may take a bit longer but is worth the wait.) Meanwhile, prepare the glaze: Place the jam in a small saucepan over medium low heat, stirring occasionally. Once the jam begins to thin, stir in the lemon juice, sugar, and salt. Heat and stir until the sugar dissolves, then remove from heat. The glaze will thicken as it cools.Bake the rolls: Place rack in the center of your oven and preheat to 375F. Bake rolls until the tops are golden and the centers reach 185F to 190F, 20-25 minutes. Check the rolls at the 15-minute markif they begin to brown too quickly, cover the pan with foil and continue baking until complete. Remove from oven and place pan on a cooling rack for 5 minutes. Drizzle with strawberry glaze and enjoy immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Prepare the dough","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pour milk into a large glass measuring cup.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404766,"name":"measuring cup","image":"measuring-cup.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add butter and microwave on high, until the mixture is warmed to the temperature directed by the yeast manufacturer (120F to 130F for Red Star Platinum Yeast).

Transfer to paper towels to drain using a slotted spoon. Add the shallots and celery and cook, stirring, until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the mushrooms and a pinch each of salt and pepper, and cook until the mushrooms give off their liquid, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the green onions and stir. Add the wine, increase the heat, and cook until it has nearly all evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the parsley and stir. Remove from the heat, stir in the cooked bacon, and let cool.Butterfly the beef roast by slicing about 3/4 of the way through, taking car not to slice all the way through the roast. Spread the butterflied beef, cut side up, flat on a surface. Spread the bacon-vegetable mixture in a line across the meat. Lay the cooked lobster meat on top of the mixture. Roll the roast up like a giant jelly roll, and tie with kitchen twine every inch.Rub the roast all over with olive oil, and season lightly with salt and pepper. Place in a heavy cast iron skillet or roasting pan and sear on all sides, about six minutes total. Place in the oven and roast to desired temperature, about 20 minutes for medium-rare.Transfer to a cutting board. Tent and let rest for 10 minutes before carving. Remove the kitchen twine and slice thickly. Place on a platter, and drizzle with the Bearnaise Sauce. Serve immediately with asparagus and roasted fingerling potatoes.In a small saucepan, bring two inches of water to a simmer. Reduce heat to keep from boiling.In a small skillet over medium heat, combine vinegar, wine, shallots, tarragon stems, and peppercorns. Bring to a simmer and cook until almost all liqiud has evaporated, leaving about two tablespoons. Pour through a strainer (or just pour carefully) into a heatproof bowl large enough to cover the mouth of the saucepan, as in a double boiler.Add the egg yolks to the vinegar mixture and whisk to combine. Set the vinegar-yolk mixture over the simmering water and cook, whisking constantly, until the yolks thicken, about 3 minutes. Check the water often; if it boils, it will get too hot and cook the egg yolks.Whisk in the butter pieces one at a time, making sure each piece is melted before adding the next, until all of the butter has been added, about 2 minutes total. Remove the sauce from heat. Whisk in the chopped tarragon leaves, and season with salt and pepper. Serve warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.In a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon, stirring, until crisp, about 5 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":10123,"name":"bacon","image":"raw-bacon.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Transfer to paper towels to drain using a slotted spoon.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404636,"name":"slotted spoon","image":"slotted-spoon.jpg"},{"id":405895,"name":"paper towels","image":"paper-towels.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the shallots and celery and cook, stirring, until soft, about 2 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11677,"name":"shallot","image":"shallots.jpg"},{"id":11143,"name":"celery","image":"celery.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Add the mushrooms and a pinch each of salt and pepper, and cook until the mushrooms give off their liquid, 3 to 4 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":6,"step":"Add the green onions and stir.","ingredients":[{"id":11291,"name":"green onions","image":"spring-onions.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":7,"step":"Add the wine, increase the heat, and cook until it has nearly all evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":1,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":8,"step":"Add the parsley and stir.","ingredients":[{"id":11297,"name":"parsley","image":"parsley.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":9,"step":"Remove from the heat, stir in the cooked bacon, and let cool.Butterfly the beef roast by slicing about 3/4 of the way through, taking car not to slice all the way through the roast.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":10,"step":"Spread the butterflied beef, cut side up, flat on a surface.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":11,"step":"Spread the bacon-vegetable mixture in a line across the meat.

In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, cumin, cayenne pepper, and salt and pepper, to taste. Add the steaks, stir to coat, and let sit 10 minutes. In a paper bag, combine the flour, cornstarch, a few pinches of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Remove the steaks from egg mixture and put into the paper bag. Roll the top of the bag to close, and shake until the steaks are evenly coated. This may be done in batches. Let the coated steak rest on a sheet tray lined with a rack for 10 minutes.                          In a deep, heavy-bottomed skillet add enough oil to reach 1/2-inch up the sides. Heat the oil over medium heat to 370 degrees F. (When a wooden spoon inserted into the oil creates tiny bubbles, the oil is ready.) Fry the steaks, in batches if necessary, flipping only once when color is golden and a poke releases no red juices, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Remove to a serving platter and serve with Diced Potato Gravy.                          In a large straight-sided skillet heat 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic and saute until tender, about 3 minutes. Whisk in the flour, stirring to combine with the butter. Add the bay leaf and broth and bring to a simmer. Cook until slightly thickened, then add the potatoes. Cook until the potatoes are tender and the gravy has thickened, about 8 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and the parsley. Serve poured over Sunny's Chicken Fried Steak.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, cumin, cayenne pepper, and salt and pepper, to taste.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":2031,"name":"cayenne pepper","image":"chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":1002014,"name":"cumin","image":"ground-cumin.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"egg.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the steaks, stir to coat, and let sit 10 minutes.

Butter the inside of a 9-inch springform pan.                          Pulse the graham crackers in a food processor until finely ground. Add the butter, hot chocolate mix and salt, and pulse until the mixture comes together and holds its shape when squeezed. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan, and press it into the bottom to make an even layer. Bake until the crust is just firm, about 10 minutes. Let cool completely. Place the pan on a large piece of foil, and fold the foil up the sides of the pan. (This helps seal the pan, to keep water out while baking.)                          For the filling: Wipe out the food processor. Pulse the cream cheese, sugar, hot chocolate mix and sour cream until completely smooth, without any lumps, scraping down the side of the bowl a few times. Add the eggs and vanilla, and pulse until incorporated. Pour the filling into the crust, and set the pan inside a roasting pan. Fill the roasting pan with enough hot water to go halfway up the side of the springform pan (but not above the foil).                          Bake the cheesecake until the edge is set but the center jiggles slightly (when you gently shake the pan, the cheesecake should move in a cohesive wave motion), 1 hour 10 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes. Turn the oven off, and open the door for a few seconds to let out some heat. Close the door, and let the cheesecake sit in the oven until cooked completely through, 1 hour more.                          Transfer the springform pan to a cooling rack. Run a knife around the edge, and let the cheesecake cool to room temperature. Wrap and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days.                          Before serving, cut the marshmallows on the diagonal, and arrange them, cut-side down, in a neat line all over the top edge of the cheesecake.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Special equipment: A 9-inch springform pan","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404650,"name":"springform pan","image":"cake-pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"For the crust: Position a rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 325 degrees F.

Line bottoms of three greased 8-in.-square baking pans with parchment paper; grease paper.

In a small saucepan, bring cream and corn syrup just to a boil. Pour over chocolate; stir with a whisk until smooth.                                                                                           Let stand at room temperature to cool and thicken slightly, about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. (Mixture will be very soft, but will thicken when spread onto cake.)

Spread remaining ganache over top and sides of cake.                                        Yield: 24 servings.                                                                                                     TWO-LAYERED DEEP & DARK GANACHE CAKE & CUPCAKES: Prepare cake as directed, using twelve paper-lined muffin cups and two greased and parchment-lined 8-in.-square baking pans. Fill muffin cups three-fourths full; bake at 375° for 15-17 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Divide remaining batter between prepared cake pans. Reduce oven setting to 325°; bake cake layers as directed.

oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.                          Put the graham crackers in a food processor and pulse until fine crumbs, about 2 1/2 cups.                          Brush a 10-inch spring form pan with some of the butter. Add the graham cracker crumbs the remaining butter, 1/4 cup of the sugar and a pinch of salt to a medium bowl and stir to combine. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and 1 inch up the side of the pan. Use the back of a measuring cup or drinking glass to pack the crust firmly and evenly in to the edges of the pan. Bake until the crust is lightly crisp and set, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool completely, then set the pan on top of a large sheet of aluminum foil and wrap the foil around the bottom of the pan and up the sides. Place the springform in a roasting pan.                          For the filling: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Whip the cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment until smooth. Add the remaining sugar and beat until just light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl and the paddle attachment as needed, about 2 minutes. Add the sweet potato puree, sour cream, eggs, vanilla, ground cinnamon and salt and beat until just combined. Scrape the filling into the cooled crust.                          Carefully pour boiling water into the roasting pan so that it goes half-way up the sides of the springform pan, being careful not to get any of the water in the springform pan. Bake until the edges of the cheesecake are set but the center still jiggles when the pan is tapped, about 2 hours. Turn off the oven and open the oven door for 1 minute to let out some heat. Close the oven door and leave the cheesecake in the oven for 1 hour more. Carefully remove the cheesecake from the roasting pan, remove the foil and cool on a wire rack. Run a thin knife or spatula around the edges of the cake to release it from the sides, (this also helps reduce cracks in the top of the cake as it chills). Cover the pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate the cheesecake 8 hours or overnight.                          For the s'more topping: Once the cheesecake has chilled completely, put the semi-sweet chocolate chips in a medium bowl. Heat the heavy cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it just comes to a simmer, about 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate chips and let stand for 1 minute, then stir the cream and chocolate together until completely smooth. Set aside to cool to room temperature.                          Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the broiler to high. Pile the miniature marshmallows on top of the cheesecake in as even of a layer as possible (it's okay if some marshmallows overlap). Place the cheesecake on a baking sheet, then broil until the tops of the marshmallows are lightly golden brown, about 1 minute. Keep the oven door slightly open and rotate the pan as needed to get even browning.                          Run a thin knife or spatula between the cake and the pan to release it from the sides. Unlock the pan and remove the ring. Spray both sides of a sharp knife with non-stick cooking spray and slice the cake into 10 even slices, spraying the knife between each slice to keep the gooey marshmallows from sticking to the knife. Drizzle each piece of cheesecake with the cooled chocolate sauce and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Special equipment: A 10-inch springform pan","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404650,"name":"springform pan","image":"cake-pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"For the crust: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":325,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":3,"step":"Put the graham crackers in a food processor and pulse until fine crumbs, about 2 1/2 cups.","ingredients":[{"id":18617,"name":"graham crackers","image":"graham-crackers.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"food-processor.png"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Brush a 10-inch spring form pan with some of the butter.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":5,"step":"Add the graham cracker crumbs the remaining butter, 1/4 cup of the sugar and a pinch of salt to a medium bowl and stir to combine.

Right before taking the cookie out of the oven, turn off the heat and stir in the vanilla. After 10 minutes, remove the bottom layer from the oven and pour the caramel over the top.

Lay on the top of caramel. Continue until the entire pan is covered, pressing the edges to seal them together. A little of the caramel may peek through, thats okay. Bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, until the bars start to get golden on the top. Cool completely before slicing. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.

Blanc are my top picks for Salmon. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. You could try District 7 Estate Chardonnay.
