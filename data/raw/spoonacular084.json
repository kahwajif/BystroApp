Styled to be fuller in body and structure than most of Jadots Mâconnais wines, it is partially fermented and aged in oak casks to add breadth to the ripe fruit notes. The lovely, elegant Chardonnay nose, offset by a gentle touch of vanilla, carries into excellent balance of medium-full fruit and acidity on the palate and a lingering finish.","price":"$21.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/435857-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":7,"score":0.7545454545454546,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Flouis-jadot-chardonnay-2013%2F134128"}]},"instructions":"Procedures                                                                              1                                                                            Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a heavy pan.

Special equipment: 3 by 15-inch piece of parchment paper, a 7 1/2 by 12-inch piece of parchment paper.              For the crust: Put an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9 by 5 by 3-inch nonstick loaf pan with vegetable oil cooking spray. Using 2 pieces of parchment paper, line the pan, allowing the excess to hang over the ends and sides.                          In a food processor, blend the biscotti and hazelnuts together until finely ground. Add the melted butter and pulse until the crumbs are moistened. Using a flexible spatula, press the crumb mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes until the edges of the crust are golden. Cool the pan on a wire rack for 20 minutes.                          For the filling: In a medium stainless steel or glass bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, 1/2 cup sugar, vanilla extract, and salt until smooth. Put the bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Whisk until the egg mixture is pale, thick and creamy, and an instant-read thermometer registers 160 degrees F, about 10 to 15 minutes. Put the bowl into a larger bowl of iced water to cool completely.                          In another medium bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the cream until thick. Add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat until the cream holds stiff peaks. Mix 1/4 of the cream into the cooled custard. Using a spatula, gently fold the remaining cream into the custard. Drop spoonfuls of the chocolate-hazelnut spread over the custard mixture and gently fold until just incorporated but still chunky. Spoon the mixture onto the prepared crust. Fold the overhanging parchment paper over the custard and freeze for at least 8 hours or up to 3 days.                          Run a thin-bladed spatula around the semifreddo between the parchment paper and the pan. Unfold the parchment paper and invert the semifreddo onto a platter. Peel off the paper and cut into 1-inch thick slices. Serve on chilled plates.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Special equipment: 3 by 15-inch piece of parchment paper, a 7 1/2 by 12-inch piece of parchment paper.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404770,"name":"baking paper","image":"baking-paper.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"For the crust: Put an oven rack in the center of the oven.

breadcrumbs: Cut off the crust from 6 slices of bread.

Set aside.\n\nPrep the artichokes: Cut off the stem, leaving 1/2 inch from the bottom row of leaves. Using kitchen scissors, cut off 1/2-inch of the tips of all of the artichoke leaves.\n \nCut 1 inch from the top of the artichoke. (It helps to use a serrated knife like a bread knife for this.)\nTake a slice of lemon and rub over the cut edges of the artichokes to keep them from turning brown.\n\nPreheat oven to 375°F (190°C).\n\nthe artichokes: Use your finger to gently pull open the center leaves of the artichokes.

Use a small metal spoon to scrape and scoop out all of the inner fuzzy choke.\n \nNote that removing the choke at this stage isn't entirely necessarily, and it does require some elbow grease. That said, it makes eating the stuffed artichoke a much easier, and more enjoyable experience.\nPlace artichokes on a sheet pan (to catch the breadcrumbs) and start stuffing the artichoke with your stuffing mix. Put some stuffing mix between each large leaf and the artichoke, as well as a generous amount in the center.\n\nBake the artichokes: Put about 1-inch of boiling water in the bottom of a Dutch oven that will snugly hold the artichokes.

It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 24 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":434685,"title":"Dr. Thanisch Bernkasteler Doctor Kabinett Riesling","description":"This wine is extremely complex with a tremendous aging potential.

Lightly butter a 9-inch springform pan; place a circle of parchment paper inside, and butter that as well.                            Melt 4 ounces of chocolate in a metal bowl placed over gently simmering water. Stir frequently until melted, then remove from the heat and let cool slightly.                            Beat the butter together with confectioners' sugar until creamy. Mix in the melted chocolate, then beat in the egg yolks, one at a time. In a clean bowl, beat egg whites with white sugar until stiff and glossy. Fold into chocolate mixture, then fold in cake flour, until incorporated. Pour into prepared springform pan, and smooth the top.                            Bake in the preheated oven until the edges begin to pull away from the sides of the pan, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out dry, about 45 minutes. Cool pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes, then run a small knife around the edge and remove the sides of the pan. Allow cake to cool completely on the base of the pan. When cool, remove from pan, and remove parchment paper; slice cake in half horizontally.                            Bring 1/4 cup water and sugar to a boil in a small saucepan.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 26 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428324,"title":"Miranda Lambert Kerosene Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"Light yet pleasingly soft with hints of pear and ripe apple.

For irregularly sized cuts like cod, you may need to slice some fillets in half lengthwise to make them thinner. Alternatively, you can slice the fish into smaller bite-sized fish sticks, about 2 inches long and 1 inch wide (the smaller pieces will be a bit easier to manage in the frying pan).In a mixing bowl, whisk together the seltzer, flour, cornstarch, salt, garlic powder, and cayenne to make a batter. The batter will bubble at first, then settle. Stir together the panko breadcrumbs and sesame seeds, then pour them onto a plate. Have an empty plate handy for the breaded fish.  Dip each piece of fish into the batter. When you pull the fish out of the batter, let the excess batter run back into the bowl.After dipping in the batter, gently roll each piece in panko crumbs to coat. Leaving too much batter on the fish will lead to clumping and will make the coating fall off the fish when frying, so make sure your fish is only lightly coated with batter before breading. Place the breaded fish onto the empty plate. Heat ½ inch of vegetable oil in a skillet over medium till hot but not smoking. Fry the breaded fish pieces in batches of 3 (if using smaller sized fish sticks, you can fry up to 6 at a time). If the oil is at the correct temperature, it should bubble and sizzle evenly—no splatters or popping. Flip the fish when they turn dark golden brown. Don't flip them till they're completely golden-- the more you flip them, the more fragile the coating will become, so try to only flip each fillet once. If your oil is at the right temperature, it should take about 4-5 minutes per side for the fish to become golden and crisp.Place fried fish pieces on a wire rack to drain, if you have one. This will keep the fish as crisp as possible. Use paper towels to catch the oil drips underneath the rack. If you don’t have a wire rack, you can drain the fish pieces on a double layer of paper towels.Once fish has drained, you make the sauce immediately and serve, or place the wire rack (without paper towels) on a baking sheet in the oven at 200 degrees F for up to 30 minutes till ready to serve. This will keep the fish warm, fresh and crisp.Just before serving, whisk together cornstarch and 2 tbsp water in the bottom of a small saucepan till dissolved. Whisk in orange juice, soy sauce, agave nectar, sesame oil and a pinch of cayenne. Heat the sauce over medium to a simmer for 2-3 minutes, whisking constantly, till it thickens slightly. Remove from heat and let it cool for 2 minutes.Serve fish hot drizzled with the warm orange sesame sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut fish (or ask your fishmonger to slice it) into single serving fillets no thicker than 1/2 inch - 1/4 inch thickness is optimal.

Sleepy Hollow consistently produces Chardonnay with intense tropical fruit character, which exhibits both richness and finesse.

Vineyard Manager and Winemaker Sam Balderas keeps yields low to increase concentration and minimizes the handling of the wine to preserve the fruit's natural essence. This wine is 100% barrel fermented in French Oak and aged on the yeast lees to impart a rich, toasty, complex character to the wine. \n\nTasting Notes for this Vintage\nConcentrated rich flavors of tropical fruit marry with mineral elements and French oak accents. A typically high level of acid produces a long, clean finish. Our signature Chardonnay, this wine can be cellared up to nine years and improves with age.

Let stand for 10 minutes until the mixture becomes foamy.In a large bowl, whisk together butter, ¼ cup sugar, salt, vanilla extract, milk, and eggs. Stir in 1 cup of flour.Add the yeast mixture and stir for 1 minute. Gradually stir in the remaining flour to form a soft dough (the mixture will be a little sticky at this point).Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, adding small amounts of flour to prevent sticking. Shape the dough into a round and place it in a large greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover with a dry towel and place the bowl in a warm place. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1½ hours.In a medium-sized bowl, beat together cream cheese, sour cream, and sugar with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat in egg until incorporated. Beat in vanilla extract and marmalade until smooth. Set aside.Grease and flour a 10-inch bundt pan.Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 10-inch by 12-inch rectangle. Using a pastry brush, brush the dough with melted butter. Spread the cheese filling evenly over the dough. Roll the dough up like a jelly roll, starting from the long end, roll the dough towards you. Pinch the ends closed. Pull the long edge of the dough up and pinch to seal. Carefully lift the rolled dough into the prepared bundt pan. Cover with a dry towel and let rise for 1 hour.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Bake the babka until deep golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven and let stand for 10 minutes; invert the babka onto a wire rack and remove the pan. Allow the babka to cool for at least 2 hours before slicing.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Sprinkle the yeast and 1 teaspoon of sugar over the warm water; stir to dissolve.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"yeast-granules.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Let stand for 10 minutes until the mixture becomes foamy.In a large bowl, whisk together butter, ¼ cup sugar, salt, vanilla extract, milk, and eggs.
