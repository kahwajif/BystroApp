salt, black pepper, and sugar; stir together on low speed with the paddle attachment.  In a 1 cup liquid measuring cup, whisk the yeast into the warmed milk until it dissolves then pour the milk mixture and the melted butter over the dry ingredients.  Mix everything together on low speed until they form a shaggy mass of dough.Switch to the dough hook and knead the dough for 6 minutes on low speed, until the dough is smooth and slightly sticky.  Alternatively, you can knead the dough by hand for about 8 minutes.  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover it with plastic wrap.  Let the dough rise in a warm spot (like a barely warm oven) until it doubles, about 2 hours.  While the dough rises, make the filling; chill it until you're ready to use it.To form the buns:  Transfer the dough from the bowl to a well-floured counter top or work surface, sprinkle the dough with a little more flour, and pat it down into a rough rectangular shape.  With a rolling pin, roll the dough out to a 12x16-inch rectangle.  Spread the filling out evenly over the dough to within 1/2\" of the edges of the dough.  Starting at the short end (or the long end if it's 6 am and you're still half asleep like I was), roll the dough tightly up into a log.  With a serrated knife, cut the dough into twelve 1-inch rolls (or 1 1/2-inch rolls if you rolled it from the long end).Line the bottom of two 9-inch round cake pans or a 13x9-inch baking dish with parchment paper and lightly grease the paper with baking spray.  Arrange 6 buns evenly spaced apart in each pan or all 12 in the large dish.  Melt the additional tablespoon of butter and brush the tops of the buns with it.  Cover the pans with plastic wrap and let the buns rise in a warm place until the buns just about double in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  When the buns have almost doubled, preheat the oven to 350 F.Bake for 20-25 minutes (remove the plastic wrap first) until the buns are golden brown and the cheese is bubbling up.  Serve immediately.  The buns will keep, covered, at room temperature for 2-3 days.  Reheat any leftovers (ha!) in a 250 F wrapped in foil until they are just warmed through.To make the biscuits: In a large bowl, stir the flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar together.  With a pastry cutter or your fingers, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until the butter resembles course meal with some larger butter lumps remaining.  Stir in 3/4 cup of the buttermilk with a fork until the mixture forms a soft, slightly sticky ball.  If the dough is too dry, add a little extra buttermilk - 1 tablespoon at a time up to 2 tablespoons.Transfer the dough to a well-floured work surface and pull it together into a ball with your floured hands.  Pat the dough out to 3/4\" thickness and cut out 12 rounds with a 3-inch biscuit or cookie cutter.  Transfer the biscuits to a parchment-lined baking sheet and chill until you're ready to use them.  The biscuits can be made and kept covered in the refrigerator for up to 2 days in advance.To make the filling:  Preheat the oven to 400 F. Heat a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat and add the oil.  Once the oil is hot, saut the onions, carrots, and celery until tender, about 5-7 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Transfer cooked vegetables to a bowl with the chicken; set aside.Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter to the same pot.  When melted, stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly for 1 minute.  Whisk in the milk, chicken broth, and thyme.  Allow the sauce to come to a simmer and let it simmer for 1 minute to thicken.  Season with salt and pepper and stir in the sherry (if using).  Turn off the heat and transfer the vegetables and chicken to the pot, stirring until the filling is well-combined.  Mix in the peas and parsley.  If the filling is too thick (you'll know), stir in the extra chicken broth, about 1/4 cup at a time up to 3/4 cup until the filling loosens up a little.Pour the filling into a 13x9-inch baking dish and bake for 18 minutes.  Remove the dish from the oven (keeping the oven on and door closed) and top the filling with the biscuits.  Return the baking dish to the oven and bake for an additional 10-12 minutes, until the biscuits are golden brown and the filling is bubbly.  Cool for 5 minutes before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the flour, salt, black pepper, and sugar; stir together on low speed with the paddle attachment.

The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

Chill until for at least an hour, or up to days (or weeks, really) in advance.Slice cherry tomatoes and toss them with a splash of olive oil, a splash of sherry vinegar, salt, pepper.Drizzle olive oil on your stale bread and toast (or grill) it until golden. While it's still warm, rub it with a sliced clove of garlic, then slice it into bite sized pieces.De-seed and slice your peppers into thick strips.

a blender, finely chop the ginger and garlic.\nAdd the water, vinegar, miso, soy sauce, honey, olive oil and sesame oil and blend until smooth. (Dressing will keep for at least a week in the refrigerator.)\n\nBake the tofu: Preheat the oven to 475ºF. Coat a baking dish or baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Cut the tofu into 1-inch cubes and thoroughly pat dry with paper towels.\nPlace the tofu in a bowl and add 3 tablespoons of the miso dressing. Toss to coat and transfer to the baking dish. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown. Toss with the scallions and an additional 2 tablespoons of the miso dressing. Set aside.\nThe tofu can be baked up to three days ahead; wait to toss with scallions and the additional miso dressing until ready to serve.\n\nCook the rice: In a large saucepan over high heat, bring 6 cups of salted water to a boil. Add the rice and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until tender (taste a few grains to test). Drain in a fine meshed sieve and transfer to a bowl until ready to use. (The rice will keep for about a week in the refrigerator.)\n\nMake the pickle brine: In a bowl, stir together the vinegar,1 teaspoon of the salt and sugar until the salt and sugar dissolve. Stir in the water.\n\nMake the cauliflower pickles: Place the cauliflower in a bowl and cover with 1 cup of the pickle brine. Let sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. (Store in the brine, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.)\n\nMake the smashed cucumber pickles: With a mallet or heavy pan, gently whack the cucumbers to crack the skin. Cut them in half lengthwise and then into 1-inch pieces. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 teaspoons of salt. Set a colander over a bowl, add the cucumbers and allow them to drain for 15 minutes.\nDiscard the liquid in the bowl. To the now-empty bowl, add the cucumbers (the cucumbers do not need to be rinsed). Toss with the remaining pickle brine (about 3 tablespoons), soy sauce, and sesame oil.\nCucumbers can be stored for a few hours before serving, but get mushy if stored for longer.\n\nMassage the kale: In a large bowl, toss the kale with the oil. Using your fingers, gently massage the oil into the leaves for about 1 minute. Tear them into bite size pieces as you work. Sprinkle lightly with salt to taste.\nThe kale can be massaged a few hours before serving, but become wilted if stored for longer.\n\nAssemble the bowls: Divide the rice between four bowls and top with tofu, cauliflower pickles, smashed cucumbers, and kale. Sprinkle with toasted almonds and currants. Serve with extra dressing on the side.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the salad dressing: In a blender, finely chop the ginger and garlic.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":11216,"name":"ginger","image":"ginger.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404726,"name":"blender","image":"blender.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the water, vinegar, miso, soy sauce, honey, olive oil and sesame oil and blend until smooth.

and cream, and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside.                          In a large, heavy skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Stir in the brown sugar, raise the heat to medium-high, and cook 5 to 7 minutes, stirring constantly, to caramelize the mixture. (You will smell a characteristic nutty-caramel odor when the butter browns, signaling that the mixture is ready.)                          Whisking constantly, gradually add the butter/brown sugar mixture to the hot milk/cream mixture. If the mixture is not smooth, blend for 20 seconds with a hand blender or pour through a fine sieve.                          Put the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Whisk in about 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture. Whisk in the cornstarch and salt until dissolved. Whisk the cornstarch mixture back into the hot milk mixture in the saucepan. Add the scotch and whisk in.                          Whisking constantly, cook over medium-high heat until thick and just boiling. When the mixture thickens, the whisk will leave trail marks on the bottom of the pot and the mixture will have a few large bubbles boiling up to the top.                          Turn off the heat and whisk in the vanilla extract. Pour into the pre-baked pie shell and chill, uncovered, at least 2 hours, or overnight.                          Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.                          For the meringue top: Whip whites with the salt to soft peaks, then add sugar and whip until sugar is dissolved and whites are glossy. Spread meringue on top of the slightly cooled pie and bake for 5 minutes until lightly browned (cappuccino colored). Chill until ready to serve.                          In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), mix the flour, salt, and sugar for 1 minute. Add the butter and mix just until you have a crumbly, sandy mixture. You should still be able to see the pieces of butter.                          In a small bowl, stir the water and vinegar together. With the mixer running at medium speed, drizzle in the water-vinegar mixture and mix just until a dough forms. You should still see small bits of butter.                          Turn out onto a work surface, divide the dough in half, and shape into round, flat disks. Wrap separately in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before using. (Or, refrigerate up to 48 hours or freeze up to 1 month before using. If frozen, let thaw in the refrigerator overnight before rolling out.)                          When the time comes to roll out the dough, let the dough warm up for a few minutes at room temperature. Dust a work surface with just a few tablespoons of flour and keep some extra flour at hand. If you like, you can roll out the dough between two sheets of waxed paper (flouring the bottom sheet and the top of the dough before rolling), which makes it much easier to transfer to the pan later on. However, you won't be able to check the progress of the dough as easily. It's entirely up to you.                          Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and start rolling outward from the center with quick, light strokes. Don't worry if the edges split a bit; concentrate on getting a good circle going from the center. Lift up and rotate the dough 1/4 turn every minute or so to help ensure even rolling. The dough should feel smooth and soft; some say it should feel like the inside of your forearm. If it gets sticky, sprinkle on a bit more flour, but don't do this more than two or three times; the dough will absorb too much flour. Instead, put it back in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to firm the butter up. Keep rolling until the circle is at least 2 inches larger than your pan (for example, 11-inches wide for a 9-inch pie pan), or 3 inches larger for deep-dish pies.                          Set your pie or tart pan nearby. We always use heavy aluminum pans, because glass pans seem to bake the crust too fast. However, we know that the advantage of glass is that you can easily check the color of the crust. Again, it's up to you. Either choice will work.                          To transfer the crust to the pan, we find it easiest to roll a finished crust up onto the rolling pin, then gently unroll it in the pan. Or, you can fold it gently in quarters, lift it up, position the center point on the center of the pan, and unfold it into the pan. If using waxed paper, peel off the top layer, turn the crust gently into the pan, and peel off the remaining paper. Make sure that the dough is allowed to settle completely into the pan.                          Don't stretch and press the dough into the corners; stretched dough will likely shrink back when you bake it. Instead, lift the edges of the crust to let it settle down into the corners. If the dough tears a bit, don't be concerned; it will patch easily. Using scissors or a sharp knife, trim the dough to within 3/4-inch of the rim. Use any extra scraps to patch the crust, pressing with your fingers (wet them if necessary) or set aside.                          For a single-crust pie: Working around the rim, turn the crust under itself (not under the rim of the pan) to make a thick edge, pressing it firmly against the pan to reduce shrinkage. To decorate the rim, just press it all around with the back of a fork. For a slightly more advanced look, press the thumb and forefinger of one hand together. Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a \"V\" with the dough in between. Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge.                          Chill the finished crust or crusts for 20 to 30 minutes before filling the pie. When the bottom crust is filled, rest the top crust on top and pinch the edges together, turning them under all the way around. To decorate the rim, just press it all around with the back of a fork. For a slightly more advanced look, press the thumb and forefinger of one hand together. Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a \"V\" with the dough in between. Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge.                          For a prebaked pie or tart crust (blind baking): Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line the inside of the chilled crust with aluminum foil (don't turn it down over the rim, but leave the extra sticking up so that you have something to hold on to). Fill the foil all the way up to the top of the shell with pie weights or dried beans. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, until dry and beginning to turn \"blond\". Lift the foil and weights out of the shell and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, checking frequently to prevent overbaking, until medium brown.                          Yield: 2 crusts                           Preparation time: 15 minutes plus rolling and shaping                           Cooking time: 30 minutes                           Ease of preparation: moderate                          Recipe courtesy Gale Gand, \"Butter Sugar Flour Eggs\" by Gale Gand, Rick Tramonto, Julia Moskin: Clarkson N.

parchment paper rounds and spray parchment paper with baking spray.Whisk together dry ingredients, flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, sea salt in a medium bowl.Lightly whisk buttermilk, oil, egg, and vanilla in a small bowl. Add to dry ingredients and blend with a handheld mixer for 1-2 minutes. Distribute batter equally between two pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes or, until a toothpick or cake tester come out clean when inserted into the center.Allow cakes to cool over cooling rack for 5-10 minutes. Remove cakes from pans allow them to come to room temperature. Wrap with plastic wrap and transfer to freezer until ready to frost.Combine sugar and water in a small saucepan, with a spoon stir until sugar looks like wet sand place pan over medium-high heat.

When the dough pulls away from the sides of the pan and forms a ball, remove the pan from the stove.3. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work space. Using a plastic dough scraper or wooden spoon, turn the warm dough to knead briefly until smooth and the dough slightly springs back when pressed with your finger. (Don’t overwork the dough.)

In a saucepan, combine the cooked chopped tomatoes and 2 cups of the reserved parsnip cooking liquid. Reduce down until it thickens slightly. Add salt and pepper to taste.  For the meatballs:  Begin by roasting the beets. Preheat oven to 350F and rinse the outside of the beets to remove any dirt or debris that may be on them. Place them in a small baking dish with a little water on the bottom and cover with foil the water will prevent the beets from scorching. Roast in the oven for about 1 hour, or until a fork inserted can be removed easily. Remove beets from dish and place in the refrigerator to cool. Once cooled, use a dish rag or strong paper towel and wipe the skin on the outside of the beets. It will come off easily. Grate the skinned beets on a fine cheese grater and reserve until later. Spread out cooked rice on a cookie sheet or large plate and allow to cool to room temperature. In a large saut pan over medium-high heat, saut the onions, celery and carrots for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the mushrooms and cook an additional 4 minutes or so. Season liberally with salt and black pepper and then add the cooled shredded beets and toss to combine. Allow this mixture to cool to room temperature as well by spreading on a cookie sheet or large plate. Once everything has cooled, combine all ingredients excluding the eggs in a large mixing bowl and check seasonings, then add eggs. Roll mixture into 2-ounce balls and place in a dish close together, flattening the bottom a little so they do not roll around. Roast at 350F for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Serve the meatballs over the parsnip pure with a little parsnip and tomato broth on top.
