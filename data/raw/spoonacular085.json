Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses.

Add all the ingredients except for coconut milk to the bowl of your food processor and process until thoroughly combined, smooth and creamy. Add coconut milk and resume processing until fully incorporated.  Place the icing in the refrigerator for about 10-15 minutes to chill and firm up. During that time, make the syrup: bring water and honey to a boil over medium heat. Stir in coffee and let this syrup simmer for a minute then kill the heat. Carefully remove the parchment paper from on the cakes. Place one of the cakes onto a cake plate and brush a few tablespoons of the coffee syrup over its entire surface. Do be fairly generous with the syrup; the cake will soak it all up and will be that much moister as a result.Mound half of the frosting right in the center of the cake and spread it evenly, all the way to the edge, creating little swirls in the icing as you go; Place the second cake on top, brush with syrup then mound the remaining frosting in the center and again, spread that frosting all the way to the edge, making pretty little swirls with your spatula as you go. Sprinkle chopped walnuts over the entire surface of the cake and place in the fridge until ready to serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat your oven to 350FGrease two 9 round cake pans with coconut oil and line the bottom with parchment paper.","ingredients":[{"id":4047,"name":"coconut oil","image":"oil-coconut.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404770,"name":"baking paper","image":"baking-paper.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add all dry ingredients to a large bowl and sift them through a mesh sieve to get rid of any potential lumps, and then mix until thoroughly combined.

Cover until ready to use.After youve started the grits, now its time to marinate the shrimp.Shrimp Marinade:Combine all the ingredients for the marinade for the shrimp in a mixing bowl.Stir well and add the shrimp, gently stirring to coat.Place bowl in the refrigerator until ready to cook the shrimp.

Set aside for at least 30 mins so that the flavours develop.\nHeat a frying pan over a high heat, add the shallots, garlic, ginger, curry powder, sugar, 4 tbsp oil and fry for 2-3 mins, stirring until caramelised. Turn down heat and add leaves from 4 thyme sprigs. Season and cook on medium heat for about 15 mins, stirring occasionally.\nDeglaze with wine vinegar, cook for another 5 mins, then stir in the crme frache and cook 2-3 mins. You should have a creamy soft mixture. Set aside to cool. The marmalade will keep in the fridge for up to 3 days.\nLightly trim the fennel roots, then quarter and cut each bulb into 8 wedges.

Drizzle with a little oil and season well.\nFor the peppers, remove stalk, slit open, remove seeds and ribs, then open out and cut into long 2cm-thick strips.\nSprinkle the bread slices with crushed salt, more thyme leaves and lightly drizzle some oil. Set all the vegetables and bread aside.\nLift meat from the marinade and lightly shake to remove any excess marinade. Place on the hot griddle (take care, as the griddle will flame up) and cook 6-7 mins each side, moving to the side of the grill if they start to burn. Press meat with the back of a fork to check for doneness (see Gordons tips, below). I serve my lamb medium rare. Allow 2 mins extra each side for well done. Remove cooked meat and leave to rest for 10 mins.\nGriddle vegetables starting with the fennel, allowing 3 mins each side until chargrilled and lightly softened. Then cook asparagus for 4-5 mins turning once, the pepper strips (3-4 mins) and finally the bread until lightly toasted. Slice the meat thinly lengthways.

processor with the flour mixture. Pulse a few times until butter has been incorporated into the flour and forms a coarse mixture.Add ice water one tablespoon at a time, pulsing in between each addition. Continue adding water 1 Tbsp. at a time until dough begins to come together but is not sticky. You may not need all of the water.Turn dough out onto a floured surface and lightly knead to bring it all together. Wrap in plastic and place in the fridge to chill for at least 30 minutes.Spray 6 4-inch tartlet pans with a light layer of cooking spray. Set aside.When dough has chilled, roll it out on a floured surface to about 1/4 inch thick. Cut dough into 5 x 5 inch squares and lay each square of dough over a greased tartlet pan. Press dough into each pan, then run a rolling pin over the top to \"cut\" any remaining dough away from the tartlet pan. Remove excess dough. Use a fork to poke a few holes in the dough of each tartlet pan. (TECHNICALLY, this is where you should place a layer of foil over the tartlet dough and fill it with baking beans or something else heavy to keep the crust from bubbling...but I'm lazy and don't do that. I know, shame on me).Place tartlet pans on a large sheet pan and bake at 375 for 15-25 minutes, until crust is a light golden brown. Remove tartlet shells from the oven and let them cool for 15 minutes or so, then gently remove the shells from the pans. I like to flip the pans over onto a cooling rack and gently tap the bottom until the shell pops out. Let shells cool completely before filling, about 30 minutes to 1 hour.Combine all filling ingredients in a medium-sized bowl and stir to combine. Spoon filling into each tart shell, filling each shell about 3/4 of the way full. Spread filling out with a spoon so that it is relatively smooth. Heat balsamic vinegar in a small saucepan or skillet over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until it has reduced to a thick syrup, 8-12 minutes.

Styled to be fuller in body and structure than most of Jadots Mâconnais wines, it is partially fermented and aged in oak casks to add breadth to the ripe fruit notes.

Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Put the noodles in a large bowl and cover with boiling water.

vanilla, and beat on medium-high speed until well combined, about 2 minutes. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the flour, pudding mix, baking soda, optional salt, and beat on low speed until just combined, about 1 minute. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the chocolate chips, and beat on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds. Mixture will look shaggy and like shredded Play-Doh bits, and is both oily and dry; this is okay. Using a large cookie scoop, 1/4-cup measure, or your hands, form approximately 12 equal-sized mounds of dough by compressing, compacting, and squeezing until the dough comes together; don't be afraid to really squeeze it. If your dough is absolutely not coming together, and is fluffy, fuzzy, or seemingly too dry, drizzle in one tablespoon of coconut oil at a time until it comes together. Do this as a last resort because it can make the dough oily in a hurry. The chips are prone to falling out, but just keep pushing them back in. Place mounds on a large plate or tray, flatten slightly (when properly chilled, cookies don't flatten much while baking so flatten them now), cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, up to 5 days. Do not bake with unchilled dough because cookies will bake thinner, flatter, and be more prone to spreading. Make sure the cookies are in the exact shape you want them before chilling, because it's exceedingly difficult to re-shape them after chilling. Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with a Silpat or spray with cooking spray. Place dough mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (I bake 8 cookies per sheet) and bake for about 11 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just set, even if slightly undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center; don't overbake. Cookies firm up as they cool. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for about 10 minutes before serving. I let them cool on the baking sheet and don't use a rack. Cookies will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months. Alternatively, unbaked cookie dough can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 4 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.
