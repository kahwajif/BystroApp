To make the pastry, in a bowl, combine the flour and salt. Place the butter in another bowl. Place both bowls in the freezer for 1 hour. Remove the bowls from the freezer and make a well in the center of the flour. Add the butter to the well and, using a pastry blender, cut it in until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Make another well in the center. In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream, lemon juice and water and add half of this mixture to the well. With your fingertips, mix in the liquid until large lumps form. Remove the large lumps and repeat with the remaining liquid and flour-butter mixture. Pat the lumps into a ball; do not overwork the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. If preparing ahead of time, the dough can be stored at this point for up to one month in the freezer.2. Divide the refrigerated dough in half. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out one half of the dough to 1/8-inch thickness. Using a 4 1/2-inch-round biscuit cutter, cut seven circles out of the rolled dough. Transfer the circles to a parchment-lined baking sheet, and place in the refrigerator to chill for about 30 minutes. Repeat the rolling, cutting, and chilling process with the remaining half of dough. (I used a 4-inch cutter-if you can call a \"cutter\" the tin edge of the container that holds my smaller round cutters-and managed to get 12 from each dough half, after rerolling the scraps.)3. Mix the diced apple with the sugar, and cook over low heat for 8-10 minutes, until the apples are tender. Set aside. Prior to preparing the pies, drain any accumulated liquid from the apples.4. Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator, and let stand at room temperature until just pliable, 2 to 3 minutes. Spoon about 1 to 2 tablespoons filling (use the smaller amount for a 4-inch circle) onto one half of each circle of dough. Quickly brush a little cold water around the circumference of the dough, and fold it in half so the other side comes down over the filling, creating a semicircle. Seal the hand pie, and make a decorative edge by pressing the edges of the dough together with the back of a fork. Repeat process with remaining dough. Place the hand pies back on the parchment-lined baking sheet, and return to the refrigerator to chill for another 30 minutes.5. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Remove the chilled hand pies from the refrigerator, cut a small slit in each and lightly brush with the egg yolk wash. Sprinkle sanding sugar generously over the pies, and place pies in the oven to bake. Bake until the hand pies are golden brown and just slightly cracked, anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes, depending on how thick you rolled the dough. Remove the pies from the oven, and let stand to cool slightly before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the pastry, in a bowl, combine the flour and salt.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the butter in another bowl.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Place both bowls in the freezer for 1 hour.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Remove the bowls from the freezer and make a well in the center of the flour.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":5,"step":"Add the butter to the well and, using a pastry blender, cut it in until the mixture resembles coarse meal.

fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture is the consistency of wet sand.Stir in the sour cream (the dough will be very wet), and then turn the dough out onto a well-floured work surface.Knead the dough a few times until it comes together, adding more flour, 1 teaspoon at a time, if the dough is too sticky to handle. Roll the dough into an 8x10-inch rectangle and dust both sides with flour before folding it into thirds as if you were folding a letter.Rotate the dough 90º and roll it out again into an 8x10-inch rectangle. Fold the dough again into thirds then wrap it securely in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 30 minutes while you make the filling.Make the filling:In a small bowl, combine the apples, lemon juice, cinnamon, sugar and flour, stirring until thoroughly mixed. Set aside.Assemble the pies:Preheat the oven to 425ºF.Remove the dough from the refrigerator and unfold it onto a well-floured surface, rolling it out to a 14x14-inch square. (See Kelly's Notes.)Using a 3-inch circular cookie cutter or cup, cut out as many circles as possible. Re-roll the scraps and continue cutting out circles until you run out of dough, ensuring you end up with an even number of circles. (You should have approximately 20 3-inch circles.)Place six of the dough circles on a Silpat or parchment paper-lined cookie sheet. Spoon a small portion of the apple filling into the center of each circle, leaving enough of a border around the filling. Top the apple filling with a portion of the chopped caramels and a pinch of sea salt. Place a second dough circle atop each filled circle then use a fork to crimp the edges together, sealing each pie.Brush each pie with the egg wash, and using a sharp knife, cut two or three vents on the top of each pie. Sprinkle the pies with crystal sanding sugar (optional). Bake the pies for about 15 minutes, or until they're golden brown. Remove the pies from the oven and allow them to rest for 10 minutes before serving. Repeat the filling and baking process with the remaining dough circles.Kelly's Notes:The cubed apples should be no larger than the size of corn kernels to ensure they become tender during the quick 15-minute bake time.Large flake sea salt is available in most supermarkets. My preferred brand is Maldon Salt.If the dough is too firm to work with after refrigerating, allow it to sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before cutting out the circular shapes.If the sour cream in the dough makes it too sticky at any point in the rolling out process, just simply sprinkle a pinch of flour atop the wet areas and continue rolling.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Make the dough","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Whisk together the flour, salt and baking powder in a large bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the cubed butter to the bowl and use your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture is the consistency of wet sand.Stir in the sour cream (the dough will be very wet), and then turn the dough out onto a well-floured work surface.Knead the dough a few times until it comes together, adding more flour, 1 teaspoon at a time, if the dough is too sticky to handle.","ingredients":[{"id":1056,"name":"sour cream","image":"sour-cream.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Roll the dough into an 8x10-inch rectangle and dust both sides with flour before folding it into thirds as if you were folding a letter.Rotate the dough 90º and roll it out again into an 8x10-inch rectangle.

Strain chicken stock through a fine mesh strainer lined with cheese clothe. Place into containers and refrigerate for a few hours so you can skim the fat off the top. You should have about 8 cups of stock.For the Dumplings:Add flour, baking powder, salt, and butter into the bowl of a food processor fitted with dough blade. Pulse until butter is incorporated and crumbly. Slowly pour milk into the flour and pulse until dough comes together. Transfer to a floured surface, sprinkle with additional flour, and roll dough out to 1/4\" thickness. Using a pizza cutter (or sharp knife) cut dough into 1\"x 2\" pieces.  For the Chicken and Dumplings:Bring 8 cups of chicken stock to a boil and season with salt and pepper. Add dumplings one at a time, stirring in between each one to be sure they don't stick together. Simmer for 10-12 minutes or until dumplings are cooked through. Take 1/3 cup of the stock and add to a bowl. Whisk in 2 heaping tablespoons of flour until combined into a smooth slurry.

In general, there are a few rules that will help you pair wine with southern food. Food-friendly riesling or sparkling white wine will work with many fried foods, while zinfandel is great with barbecued fare. One wine you could try is J. Lohr Bay Mist White Riesling.

The aromas are expanded on the palate, adding orange blossom and lychee. With 2.56% residual sugar balanced by the naturally crisp acidity and spritz from a long cool fermentation, the White Riesling is a refreshing wine capable of complementing the vibrant flavors of Pacific Rim cuisine or standing on its own as an aperitif.","price":"$8.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/436820-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8400000000000001,"ratingCount":9,"score":0.8042857142857144,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fj-lohr-bay-mist-white-riesling-1998%2F6188"}]},"instructions":"1                               In 3-quart saucepan, heat whipping cream, milk, 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar,salt and vanilla bean (if you are using 1 teaspoon vanilla, do not add here) uncovered to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Simmer about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat. Cover and let stand 20 minutes. (This standing time will infuse the cream with vanilla flavor; skip it if not using vanilla bean.) Remove and discard vanilla bean.                                                          2                               In medium bowl, beat 1/3 cup granulated sugar and egg yolks with wire whisk 3 minutes or until yolks lighten to lemon yellow. Ladle about 1 cup warm cream mixture into egg yolks and beat with wire whisk to combine. Repeat with another cup of cream mixture. Add yolk mixture to remaining cream mixture in saucepan.                                                          3                               Stir constantly with rubber spatula, making sure to scrape the bottom of pan. Heat over medium heat 10 to 15 minutes or until mixture thickens slightly and coats back of metal spoon. (Do not boil or overheat mixture because eggs will curdle.) Pour into medium bowl, using a strainer if there are any lumps. (If using 1 teaspoon vanilla instead of vanilla bean, add it now.) Cover with plastic wrap, pushing wrap onto custard surface to prevent film from forming. Cool at room temperature 15 minutes. Refrigerate at least 8 hours but no more than 24 hours. Place ice-cream maker bowl in freezer.                                                          4                               (If using frozen peaches, skip step 4.) In 4-quart Dutch oven, heat 2 quarts water to boiling. Add fresh peaches and allow them to bob in water 30 seconds. Use slotted spoon or strainer to remove peaches and immediately plunge into bowl of ice water to cool. Remove skins from peaches. Cut peaches in half and twist to separate halves. Remove and discard pits. Cut each peach half into 4 pieces.                                                          5                               In bowl of food processor, pulse peaches, lemon juice and remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar until peaches are roughly chopped but not pureed (you are aiming for a chunky peach sauce). Stir in vodka if using. You should have about 2 cups chopped peaches. Refrigerated chopped peaches until cold, at least 1 hour.                                                          6                               Place large bowl in freezer at least 1 hour before churning ice cream. Strain the chilled peaches and collect any accumulated juice in a medium bowl. Combine the peach liquid with the cold ice cream custard mixture and stir well. Refrigerate drained peaches until needed. Freeze custard in ice-cream maker following manufacturers directions until thick (like soft-serve ice cream). Scrape ice cream from ice-cream maker into the cold bowl. Quickly add chopped peaches; gently stir until peaches are evenly distributed.                                                          7                               Smooth top of ice cream flat and cover directly with plastic wrap.

To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Talbott Sleepy Hollow Chardonnay () with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Sleepy Hollow consistently produces Chardonnay with intense tropical fruit character, which exhibits both richness and finesse. Sleepy Hollow Chardonnay is considered by many as one of the quality standards for California Chardonnay. Vineyard Manager and Winemaker Sam Balderas keeps yields low to increase concentration and minimizes the handling of the wine to preserve the fruit's natural essence. This wine is 100% barrel fermented in French Oak and aged on the yeast lees to impart a rich, toasty, complex character to the wine. \n\nTasting Notes for this Vintage\nConcentrated rich flavors of tropical fruit marry with mineral elements and French oak accents. A typically high level of acid produces a long, clean finish. Our signature Chardonnay, this wine can be cellared up to nine years and improves with age.
