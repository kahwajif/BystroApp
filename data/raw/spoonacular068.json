dish"],"diets":[],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350F and line an 8 x 8-inch baking pan with aluminum foil, allowing for overhang (do not make this recipe unless you line your pan with foil) and spray the foil down very well with cooking spray. In a large microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter. To the melted butter add the oats, brown sugar, baking soda, flour*, one teaspoon vanilla, and stir to combine. Pour just over half the oat-butter mixture (about 60%, eyeball it) into the bottom of the prepared baking pan, spread it evenly with a spatula, and bake for 9-10 minutes. The mixture will bubble up and foam considerably while baking. Watch it closely and the sides will show a bit of browning at about 9-10 minutes. Remove pan from oven and let it rest and cool for 3 minutes, and then sprinkle the chocolate chips over the top in an even layer. While the mixture is baking, unwrap the caramels and place them in a medium-sized saucepan that's been sprayed with cooking spray. Add the cream to the caramels and melt over medium-high heat, stirring nearly continuously to prevent scorching or boiling. It may take 5 minutes for caramels to completely melt. After mixture has melted, is smooth and combined, turn off the heat and add one teaspoon of vanilla, using caution because the vanilla will likely bubble up a bit, and stir to incorporate. Pour the melted creamy caramel mixture over the top of the oat mixture that has been topped with chocolate chips. It will be very soupy, this is fine. Take the remaining half (40%) of the oat-butter mixture and sprinkle it as evenly as possible over the top, using a spatula to gently spread the oats within the \"caramel soup\". Place pan on top of a cookie sheet as a precaution for spill-over and bake for 14-16 minutes more, or until sides of the mixture are beginning to brown (Look closely in order to discern \"browning edges\" from the overall brown color of the caramel mixture when it's baking; they're very similar but distinct enough to differentiate). The mixture will be bubbling quite intensely while baking and watch it for signs of spilling over. Remove pan from the oven and allow it to rest and completely cool on the countertop before attempting to slice the bars (at least two hours) or you can expedite the process by placing the pan in the freezer or refrigerator until sufficiently cool enough to slice (but not frozen). Store bars in an airtight container in the refrigerator, or freezer, and freeze extras for up to 3 months. I stored these bars in the freezer because they were so gooey and they never froze solid (all that butter). Notes: *I did not add flour to the bars as they are shown here and they are incredibly gooey and are hard to keep in a \"neat\" bar form, which only matters if you're trying to take pictures of them or transport them. If you prefer something less gooey and sticky and more portable, add 1/2 cup flour. If you do not have caramel squares, you could use 2 cups of caramel sauce for ice cream and the thicker and richer, the better; however, I have not tested the recipe with caramel sauce. Oats are a gluten free grain but use certified GF if necessary and take care the caramels used are GF. To make the recipe vegan, use margarine in place of butter, cashew cream (1/4 cup cashews, soaked, and blended with 3/4 cup water) or another nut-based or vegan milk in place of the cream, and use vegan caramels.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350F and line an 8 x 8-inch baking pan with aluminum foil, allowing for overhang (do not make this recipe unless you line your pan with foil) and spray the foil down very well with cooking spray.

To make the recipe vegan, use margarine in place of butter, cashew cream (1/4 cup cashews, soaked, and blended with 3/4 cup water) or another nut-based or vegan milk in place of the cream, and use vegan caramels.","ingredients":[{"id":19074,"name":"caramel candy","image":"soft-caramels.jpg"},{"id":19074,"name":"caramel","image":"soft-caramels.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":8120,"name":"oats","image":"rolled-oats.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]}]}]},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":true,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":20,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"preparationMinutes":5,"cookingMinutes":0,"sourceUrl":"http://mywholefoodlife.com/2013/09/23/nutella-overnight-oats/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/nutella-overnight-oats-496431","aggregateLikes":1951,"spoonacularScore":86,"healthScore":13,"creditsText":"My Whole Food Life","sourceName":"My Whole Food Life","pricePerServing":92.55,"extendedIngredients":[{"id":12006,"aisle":"Health Foods","image":"chia-seeds.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"chia seeds","original":"2 tsp chia seeds","originalString":"2 tsp chia seeds","originalName":"chia seeds","amount":2,"unit":"tsp","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":2,"unitShort":"tsps","unitLong":"teaspoons"},"metric":{"amount":2,"unitShort":"tsps","unitLong":"teaspoons"}}},{"id":12220,"aisle":"Health Foods;Baking","image":"flax-seeds.png","consitency":"solid","name":"flax meal","original":"1 tsp flax meal","originalString":"1 tsp flax meal","originalName":"flax meal","amount":1,"unit":"tsp","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"tsp","unitLong":"teaspoon"},"metric":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"tsp","unitLong":"teaspoon"}}},{"id":19911,"aisle":"Cereal","image":"maple-syrup.png","consitency":"liquid","name":"maple syrup","original":"optional: 1 medjool date chopped or 1 tsp maple syrup","originalString":"optional: 1 medjool date chopped or 1 tsp maple syrup","originalName":"optional: medjool date chopped or 1 tsp maple syrup","amount":1,"unit":"","meta":["chopped"],"metaInformation":["chopped"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""},"metric":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""}}},{"id":1077,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"milk.png","consitency":"liquid","name":"milk","original":"1/2-1 cup milk (I used almond milk)","originalString":"1/2-1 cup milk (I used almond milk)","originalName":"milk (I used almond milk)","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","meta":["(I used almond milk)"],"metaInformation":["(I used almond milk)"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":0.5,"unitShort":"cups","unitLong":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":118.294,"unitShort":"ml","unitLong":"milliliters"}}},{"id":19125,"aisle":"Nut butters, Jams, and Honey","image":"hazelnut-chocolate-spread.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"nutella","original":"1 T homemade nutella","originalString":"1 T homemade nutella","originalName":"homemade nutella","amount":1,"unit":"T","meta":["homemade"],"metaInformation":["homemade"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsp"},"metric":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsp"}}},{"id":8120,"aisle":"Cereal","image":"rolled-oats.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"rolled oats","original":"1/2 cup steel cut or rolled oats (I used gluten free steel cut oats)","originalString":"1/2 cup steel cut or rolled oats (I used gluten free steel cut oats)","originalName":"steel cut or rolled oats (I used gluten free steel cut oats)","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","meta":["gluten free","(I used steel cut oats)"],"metaInformation":["gluten free","(I used steel cut oats)"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":0.5,"unitShort":"cups","unitLong":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":118.294,"unitShort":"ml","unitLong":"milliliters"}}}],"id":496431,"title":"Nutella Overnight Oats","readyInMinutes":5,"servings":1,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/496431-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"dishTypes":["side dish"],"diets":["gluten free","lacto ovo vegetarian"],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{"pairedWines":[],"pairingText":"","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Combine all the ingredients in a jar and mix well.

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons butter. Using a whisk, whisk in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the flour does not have a raw flavor, about 2 minutes. The mixture will bubble a bit; do not let it brown. Whisk in the milk, making sure the mixture is smooth and there are no lumps. Continue to cook and stir as the sauce thickens. Whisk in 8 ounces of the cheese until melted and bring the mixture to a boil. Add salt and white pepper to taste, lower the heat and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove from the heat and set aside. (To cool this sauce for later use, cover it with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming on the top of the sauce.)                          Pile up the remaining 12 ounces grated cheese on some wax paper and mold the cheese back together with your hands. Roll the cheese out as if you were rolling dough.

Lightly brush the pan with olive oil.                          Brush both sides of the burgers with olive oil. Sprinkle on a generous amount of salt and some brown sugar. Cook the burgers on the grill pan for 5 to 6 minutes on the first side.

Heat on high for 1 minute, then remove and stir. Continue heating in 20 second intervals, pausing after each to stir, until the butter is melted and the milk is warm to the touch but not hot. If needed, let the milk mixture sit for a few minutes until it is warm but not hot.In a separate bowl, whisk together 3 cups flour (not all of the flour), sugar and salt until combined.In the bowl of a stand mixer (*see note below for an alternative method of making this by hand*) fitted with the dough hook attachment, add yeast and lukewarm milk mixture and stir by hand to combine. Add the flour mixture and egg, and beat on medium-low speed until combined. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add the remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to form a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Continue beating for 5 minutes on medium-low speed. Remove the dough hook and cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest for 10 minutes.When the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured work surface. Then use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 14 x 9 inches in size. (If you want all edges to be even, you can use a pizza slicer to cut the dough into a perfect rectangle.) Use a knife or spoon to spread the Nutella evenly over the top of the surface, leaving a 1/4-inch border at the bottom of the 14-inch edge (so that the Nutella doesn't ooze out). Sprinkle the cinnamon evenly on top of the Nutella. (If it's too thick, pop the Nutella in the microwave for a few seconds to make it easier to spread.)Beginning at the top 14-inch edge (the edge with the Nutella spread clear to the border), tightly roll up the dough. Then give the final seam a little pinch so that it seals. Use a piece of dental floss*** to \"cut\" off the two ends of the roll (an inch on each end - discard that dough) so that they are even. Then cut the remaining dough into 11 or 12 equal pieces. (11 rolls seem to fit in a pie plate, while 12 rolls fit in a rectangular pan.)Place each of the cut cinnamon rolls into a greased pie plate or 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Then cover again with a damp towel, and leave the dish in a warm place to rise for 25 minutes. (I typically turn on my oven to 200 degrees, then turn it off and place the dish in the oven with the door cracked open. It's a great option if you don't have a vent or a warm window nearby.)While the dough is rising, make the icing (instructions below).When the rolls have risen, uncover the dish. Then place on the center rack of the oven and bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes, or until the rolls are golden and cooked through. Remove and let cool on a wire rack for at least 5 minutes. Drizzle with your desired icing and Nutella and serve.Either in the bowl of an electric stand mixer, or a mixing bowl, whisk softened butter and cream cheese together until combined. Then whisk in powdered sugar until combined.

Gradually pour in the water, stirring the flour with a wooden spoon or chopsticks as you pour the flour.\nOnce the water is all absorbed by the flour, start kneading the dough together with your hands. When you have incorporated all the loose flour into the dough, turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough for another 6 to 7 minutes. The dough should be elastic and quite smooth on the top. To see if the dough has been kneaded enough, rip out a golf ball-sized piece of dough, and pull it apart gently, as if you are tugging the dough at 4 corners. You should be able to stretch the dough out enough so that the center is translucent without the dough ripping apart. One or two minor tears around your fingers is okay. Shape the dough into a ball.\nLightly grease a bowl with oil and place the ball of dough inside. Cover it with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for 1 hour. You can also refrigerate the dough overnight, which is what I prefer (see notes below for instructions).\n\nPrepare the Shallots\n\nHeat a tablespoon of canola oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook them for 2 to 3 minutes, until they start to soften.\nTurn off the heat and transfer the cooked shallots into a bowl.\n\nShape the Pancakes (use photos above for reference)\n\nTake the rested dough out of the bowl and divide it into 4 pieces, about 120g to 125g each. Shape each piece into a ball. Cover the balls of dough with a dry towel or piece of plastic wrap.\nLightly grease your work surface with oil (can be a large wooden board or marble slab). Roll out the dough into a thin rectangle. The dough should be thin enough that you can almost see the surface underneath. I never roll out a perfectly shaped rectangle, so do not worry if yours look lopsided. Also dont sweat about any small tears you might create when rolling out the dough.\nPour about 2 teaspoons of oil over the rolled out dough and use your hands to rub over the surface. Lightly dust the dough with about 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon five-spice powder (I used this dusting wand). Sprinkle a quarter of the cooked shallots and sliced scallions over the dough. Fold the dough into thirds: grab the bottom length of the dough and fold it over the center of the dough, leaving a third of the dough unfolded. Next, grab the top third of the dough and fold it down over the center. Give everything one more fold. Dont fold the dough too tightlya little bit of air in between the folds is perfectly fine. Gather the dough together and give it a little tug on the ends to stretch out the dough just a little.\nStarting from one end, start curling the dough, creating a snail-like shape. You can either tuck the other end underneath the curled up dough or lay it on top. Repeat for the other remaining balls of dough, making sure to grease the work surface again if necessary.\n\nCook the Pancakes\n\nLightly grease the work surface again. Take one of the curled up balls of dough and roll it out into a thin circle. The rolling might force out some of the shallots and scallions, and thats okay. It happens to me all the time.\nHeat a 12-inch skillet with 1 1/2 tablespoons of canola oil over medium-high heat. Transfer the pancake to the pan and cook it for 3 to 4 minutes, until the pancakes are golden brown, flipping about halfway through. Transfer the pancakes to a wire cooling rack. If you dont have a rack, transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate.\nWhile one pancake is cooking, roll out the next one. Add more oil to the pan and cook the remaining pancakes. These scallion pancakes are best consumed while theyre still warm. You can tear them apart or cut them into small wedges. Serve on their own or with your favorite dipping sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the Dough","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.

If serving it cold, place the mixing bowl of custard into a larger bowl filled with ice and water, and stir the mixture occasionally until cool to the touch.  Transfer the mixture to a sealed jar or storage container and store in the refrigerator for up to two days before proceeding to the final steps and serving.                                                                                                                             6                                                                            Whip the heavy cream to soft peaks, about the consistency of Cool Whip. (Do not over-whip or the cream will be difficult to incorporate, resulting in an eggnog with errant lumps of whipped cream and a less frothy texture.)                                                                                                                              7                                                                            Add the liquor to the custard mixture, stirring well to distribute. (If serving the eggnog warm, gently warm the liquor before adding it to the custard.  Do not heat it too thoroughly or it will scramble the custard.)                                                                                                                              8                                                                            Then, using a balloon whisk (bulbous, with large openings between spokes) or a spatula, gently fold in the whipped cream.

Prepare the cake mix according to package instructions, substituting the buttermilk for the water in recipe. Fill the brioche tins and cupcakes 2/3 of the way to the top. You should get about 18 cupcakes. Bake, rotating pans halfway, until tops are golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

Remove from the oven and cool 5 minutes before unmolding and cooling completely on a wire cooling rack.                          To make the poured icing for mini fluted cakes: Combine 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar with enough lemon juice to form a thin glaze about the consistency of syrup. Dye with equal amounts of red and blue food coloring until the desired lavender color is reached. Place the cakes upside down on a cooling rack fitted inside a sheet tray. Pour the icing over the top of the cakes, allowing it to drip down the sides and completely coat the cake. Allow to set up.                          Meanwhile, mix enough of the confectioner's sugar (1/4 to 1/3 cup) for the icing to thicken; it should be about the consistency of pancake batter. Add an additional drop or 2 of each food coloring to deepen the color. Place the icing in a small zip top bag and snip the corner. Pipe just over the top of the fluted cake, allowing it to drip down the sides.                          To make the frosting for the cupcakes, combine the can of vanilla frosting with enough of the remaining confectioners' sugar to stiffen slightly and allow the frosting hold a shape when piped. Color with equal amounts of red and blue food coloring to the desired lavender color. Place in a pastry bag or a resealable zip top bag fitted with a round pastry tip. Put 12 cupcakes into lavender cupcake covers. Pipe the frosting on top, holding the tip just above surface of the cupcake and raising slightly as you squeeze to form a ball of frosting.                          To assemble: Place the cupcakes evenly spaced on the largest bottom tier and top each with a small sprig of lavender. On the middle tier arrange the fluted cakes evenly.

In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish.

Add the onion, bell peppers, carrots and 1/2 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring frequently, until the carrots begin to soften, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 2 more minutes. Add the chili powder, cumin, coriander, oregano, chipotle, tomato paste and tortillas and cook, stirring, until the tomato paste is brick red, about 4 minutes (add a splash of water if the mixture begins to stick). Add the coffee and simmer until almost completely reduced, about 30 seconds. Stir in the tomatoes, cocoa powder, beans and 2 1/2 cups water and bring to a simmer over low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the chili thickens slightly, about 1 hour, 30 minutes.                          Meanwhile, trim the large stems off the cauliflower and coarsely grate the florets on a box grater. About 10 minutes before the chili is done cooking, stir in the grated cauliflower. Cook 10 minutes, then remove from the heat. Stir in the chopped cilantro and season with salt. Add some water if the chili is too thick. Ladle into bowls and add toppings.

If you used loaf pan, slice the bread down the middle so you have two pieces.\n Warm a nonstick skillet over the stove. If desired, you can melt a little butter into the pan which will add a buttery coating to the breads. However, if you're trying to save some calories, you don't need to add anything as long as you are using a nonstick pan. Lightly toast the more even surface side of your two breads. Flip the breads so the more even surface is now on top and sprinkle one bread generously with shredded cheese. Cover the cheese with the other bread. Place a small lid (one that is smaller than your skillet and just fits over the bread) on top to weigh down the bread and to increase the heat surrounding the bread.
