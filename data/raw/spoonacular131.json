cabbage separately or use two pots. Boil the cabbages for 5 minutes. Scoop cabbages out and cool under cold running water. When cool enough to handle, peel away the large softened leaves and set aside. After you peel off 6 or 7 leaves, you may need to put the cabbage back in the boiling water for a few more minutes to soften the inner leaves. When you have 25 leaves, set them aside and roughly chop the rest of the cabbage and put 8 cups of chopped cabbage into a large bowl. (if there is any remaining cabbage, use for salad or another recipe) Add the roughly chopped green pepper, celery, and sliced onion to the bowl with the chopped cabbage and set aside.MAKE THE SAUCE: Combine tomatoes, lemon juice, brown sugar and raisins in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved, 2-3 minutes. Turn off the heat and set aside.MEAT MIXTURE: Put the ground beef in a large bowl. Add eggs, raw rice, finely chopped vegetables, salt and pepper. Mix until just combined.ASSEMBLE THE DISH: Put half of the chopped and sliced vegetables into the bottom of a large heavy pot or Dutch oven. Pour half of the sweet and sour tomato sauce over the vegetables. Stuff the cabbage leaves by scooping a heaping tablespoon of the meat mixture onto the center of a cabbage leaf. Fold the thick end of the leaf over the meat (if the end is extremely thick, cut off a bit). Fold in the two sides until they almost meet in the middle. Then roll up and place onto bed of vegetables, seam side down. Continue until all the meat is rolled, making two layers of cabbage rolls, if necessary. Cover the cabbage rolls with the rest of the chopped vegetables or as much as can fit in the pot. Pour the rest of the sauce on top. Bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover, and simmer for 3 hours. Serve cabbage rolls with sauce spooned over them and enjoy!Stuffed cabbage can be made a few days ahead and kept in the fridge. Stuffed cabbage also freezes well. One cabbage makes a great appetizer.

dish"],"diets":[],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"Blanch the asparagus: Blanch the asparagus for 2 minutes in boiling salted water (1 1/2 teaspoons of salt for every quart of water). Drain. Rinse in cold water to stop cooking. Set aside to let cool.\n\nCook the shallots, garlic, thyme in butter: Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in saucepan on medium heat. Add shallots, garlic, and thyme. Cook gently until soft, do not let brown. About 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.\n\nPurée asparagus and shallots: Purée asparagus and shallot together in a blender. Measure out 1 1/4 cup of purée.\n\nPrep the ramekins: Butter 6 8-ounce ramekins. Coat well with the breadcrumbs, reserving any leftover bread crumbs.\n\nMake a thick béchamel sauce: Over medium-low heat, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a medium sized saucepan. Add the cake flour and whisk to completely incorporate the flour into the butter, continue to stir for a couple of minutes. Do not let brown.\nVery slowly, add the milk to the mixture, little by little, whisking constantly.\nStir in 1/2 teaspoon of salt, the nutmeg, cumin, mustard, ginger, and some fresh ground black pepper.\nLower the heat to low and let cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to keep the mixture from sticking to the pan.\nAfter 15 minutes, remove the béchamel from the heat and stir in the cheese.\n\nMake the soufflé base: Combine the béchamel and the asparagus mixture in a large mixing bowl (if you have a mixing bowl with a pour lip on the side, use it, it will make it easier to pour out later). Taste the mixture and adjust the seasonings. The soufflé base should be well-seasoned.\nStir in the egg yolks until well combined.\nAt this point you can make ahead the soufflé mixture. Refrigerate to store for up to two days. Return to room temperature before proceeding.\n\nPreheat oven to 400°F.\n\nPrepare to make a water bath (a bain marie). Have ready a 9x12 baking dish with at least 2 inch sides. Put on a kettle of water to boil.\n\nBeat the egg whites: Add a pinch of salt to the egg whites and using a very clean mixer, beat the egg whites to firm but soft, almost stiff, peaks. (Make sure there are no traces of egg yolk or shell in your egg whites before starting.) Do not over-beat. Over-beating results in stiff peaks that are dry, somewhat reminiscent of styrofoam.\n\nFold egg whites into asparagus mixture: Use a rubber spatula to first fold in one quarter of the beaten egg whites into the asparagus mixture, then the remaining three-quarters. Use a light touch to keep from deflating the egg whites.\n\nFill ramekins, place in bain marie: Fill ramekins with the mixture up to a quarter-inch from the top. If you want, sprinkle leftover breadcrumbs on top.\nPlace the ramekins in the bain marie baking dish. Place baking dish on the middle rack in the oven.\nPour boiling water into the baking dish around the ramekins until the water comes up halfway the sides of the ramekins.\n\nBake: Bake for 10 minutes at 400°F, reduce the heat to 350°F and bake for about 15 minutes more, until puffed up and golden brown. Don't open the oven door until the soufflé is just about done, or it may fall.\n\nMake ahead instructions: You can serve the soufflés immediately or you can serve them later. To proceed for serving them later, let the soufflés sit in the bain marie for 15 minutes. Then use run a sharp knife around the edges and invert the individual soufflés to a buttered baking sheet.\nCool to room temperature, wrap in plastic and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Return to room temperature before re-baking. Heat oven to 400°F, bake the soufflés on a buttered baking sheet, not in ramekins, for 7-8 minutes, and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Blanch the asparagus: Blanch the asparagus for 2 minutes in boiling salted water (1 1/2 teaspoons of salt for every quart of water).","ingredients":[{"id":11011,"name":"asparagus","image":"asparagus.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Drain.

Place the raw potato and 1 cup of cold water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook until the potato is done (it slides off a knife when pierced after 10-15 minutes).Drain the potatoes, reserving the cooking water in a glass liquid measuring cup. Add enough fresh water to the reserved water to equal ¾ cup TOTAL. (Note: you may not have to add any water at all). Place a thermometer inside the water and wait until it cools down to 108-115-degrees F.Meanwhile, mash the drained potatoes and set aside in a medium bowl.Once the water has cooled to the ideal temperature range, add the yeast and a pinch of the sugar. Stir to dissolve, and then let rest until foamy, about 5 minutes. If the yeast does not foam, it's dead. Start over with fresh water and fresh yeast. (If this does happen to you, you could use all plain water for this step--no need to boil extra potatoes).Next, to the bowl with the cooled mashed potatoes add the sugar and melted butter. Stir very well to combine--no lumps! Then, add the yeast-water mixture. Stir well.Finally, add the flour, and mix until combined. Grab the sticky dough in one hand, and smear the extra butter up the sides of the bowl. Place the dough back in the bowl, cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place for 45 minutes-1 hour, or until doubled. If your kitchen is cool, turn on the oven to 200-degrees for 5 minutes, turn it off, and place the bowl inside to rise.After rising is complete, the dough can be punched down and refrigerated overnight to bake in the morning. I've had great results make the dough the night before.If not refrigerating overnight, flour your hand, then punch down the dough very well after its first rise. Gather the dough into a ball and roughly knead it a few times. Add enough flour to get it going into a ball that you can roll out. For me, this varies between 1-4 tablespoons, depending on the humidity that day.Next, we'll roll out the dough and fill it: Dust the counter with flour, and dump the dough onto the flour. Flour your hands, then pat out the dough into a 6\" square. In a small bowl, combine the melted butter, brown sugar and 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon. Let it sit for a minute or so, then spread it evenly on the dough--almost to the edges.Gently, roll up the square, starting on the edge of dough closest to you. Roll tightly, and pinch the edge together when you get to the end (see photo for reference). Slice the roll in half, then place in a greased loaf pan.Let the rolls rise in the loaf pan in a warm place for 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 375. Bake the rolls in the oven for 25 minutes. The rolls will be brown, don't be afraid of color.Take the rolls out of the oven, and combine the remaining ½ teaspoon cinnamon, powdered sugar, and splash of milk. Pour the glaze on the warm rolls, and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"See the note about the potato below.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the raw potato and 1 cup of cold water in a small saucepan.

In a large bowl, combine the soy sauce, wine, pepper and cornstarch. Add in the chicken and mix well. Let marinate for 10 minutes (or up to overnight in the refrigerator). 2. Heat a wok or large saute pan over high heat. When hot, swirl in just 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil. Stir fry the ground chicken until browned. Remove browned ground chicken from wok to a bowl and set aside.3. Wipe the wok clean and turn heat to medium. When just starting to get hot, swirl in the remaining cooking oil. Add in the green onion, garlic and ginger and cook for 30 seconds. Take care not to burn these aromatics. Add in the carrots and cabbage. Stir well and turn the heat to medium-high. Stir fry the vegetables for 2 minutes, or until the carrots have softened. Add the cooked chicken back into the wok, stir well. Add in the oyster sauce and toss again. Spread the mixture out on a baking sheet to let cool. Prop up the baking sheet on one end so that any liquid collects on the other side. When the mixture is cool, discard the liquid. 4. In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and water. This is your slurry. Open the egg roll wrapper package, cover with barely damp towel to prevent drying out.5. Add 1 tablespoon of filling to egg roll (see photos for instructions) and roll up. Secure with cornstarch slurry. Keep rolled egg rolls covered with plastic wrap to prevent drying. 6. When ready to fry, heat 1 1/2\" of oil in a wok or deep, heavy skillet to 350F (see tip in photos if you don't have thermometer). Carefully slide in the egg rolls, a few at a time, to the oil to fry.

great choices for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Loveblock Pinot Gris.

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 14 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":452761,"title":"Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio","description":"Pinot Grigio Ramato continues a tradition of the Republic of Venice, since “ramato”, or coppery, was the term referred to Pinot Grigio in contracts. A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":5,"score":0.8175000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fattems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014%2F160114"}]},"instructions":"In a 10- to 12-inch, heavy, nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot. Add the scallions and ginger and cook, stirring occasionally, until theyre just golden, with some green still visible on the scallions, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat, and with a slotted spoon, transfer the vegetables to paper towels to drain (leave the oil in the skillet). Toss the ginger and scallions lightly with salt.    Line up three wide shallow dishes. Put the flour in the first; beat the egg in the second; put the peanuts in the third. Season the tilapia fillets with salt. Dredge one fillet in the flour, shaking off the excess. Dip the fillet in the egg, then coat it with peanuts. Set the fillet on a plate and repeat with the second fillet.    Reheat the oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tilapia fillets and cook until golden on each side and the flesh is opaque and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes on each side (reduce the heat if they brown too fast). Put the tilapia on dinner plates, sprinkle with the rice vinegar and pepper to taste, top with the frizzled vegetables, and serve immediately.    Variations          Alternative coatings:Instead of peanuts, try coating the fish with cashews or sesame seeds. Or just season the fillets with salt and pepper and sear them with no coating at all.

Heat the garlic and 2 tablespoons of the oil together in a large skillet over medium heat until the garlic begins to brown around the edges, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil and 1 teaspoon salt. Fill the empty tomato can with 1 1/2 cups of water , swish it around and add it to the pan. Raise the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened, 20 to 24 minutes. (You should have about 4 cups.) Allow the sauce to cool.                          Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.                          Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking up with a slotted spoon into smaller pieces no more than 1 inch long. Cook until browned, about 7 minutes. Transfer the cooked sausage with the spoon to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain.                          Add the lasagna noodles one at a time to the boiling water and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes. Stir very gently with a wooden spoon to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain into a colander and rinse under cold water until they are cool enough to handle; drape over the side of the colander. (This will also help to separate the sheets so they do not stick together.)                          Mix the ricotta, parsley and egg with 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until well combined. Add the turkey and sausage and stir to combine. Set aside.                          Spoon a very scant layer of sauce, about 1/4 cup, into a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and spread to coat the bottom. Line the bottom with one layer of lasagna noodles, slightly overlapping and cutting to fit if necessary. Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then a third of the tomato sauce, followed by a third of the mozzarella and a third of the Parmesan. Cover with a third of the lasagna noodles, again arranged so they are overlapping slightly. Top with the other half of the ricotta mixture, then another third of the sauce. Add another third of the mozzarella and third of the Parmesan. Finish with the remaining lasagna sheets and top the lasagna with the remaining sauce, mozzarella and Parmesan.

With the mixer still on medium speed, slowly add the sugar to the butter, either one tablespoon at a time, or in a very slow steady stream, taking from 4 to 8 minutes to add all of the sugar, and beating until the butter and sugar are fully incorporated and the mixture is a light, or pale yellow color, with a fluffy texture. While adding the sugar, stop the mixer occasionally to scrape the mixture off the paddle and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly.Add egg yolks one at a time, beating until thoroughly mixed.With the mixer on low speed, add about one third of the flour mixture, mix just until the flour is almost completely blended. Scrape the bowl down, and add about one half of the milk mixture, blending just until mixed. Scrape the bowl down again and continue alternating with the flour mixture and milk mixture, ending with the last portion of the flour, and stirring just until blended.Bake: Spoon the batter into the prepared pans and smooth the surface with the back of a large spoon.

Heat over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Stir gently to avoid splashing the mixture onto the sides of the pan. When the mixture begins to simmer, cover the pan tightly with a lid for 3 to 4 minutes to allow condensation to form and run down the inside of the pan to help wash away stray sugar crystals.Increase the heat to medium high and bring to a boil, without stirring, until the syrup reaches a temperature of 290 degrees F, using a candy or instant read thermometer to gauge the temperature.When the mixture has reached 290 degrees, immediately add the pepitas, stirring to mix. Continue boiling the mixture, stirring and scraping the pot bottom to avoid scorching, until the mixture reaches a temperature of 300 degrees F, a hard crack stage. Be careful, the sugar is extremely hot and will burn your skin if you touch it. Immediately remove pan from the heat. Tip: Lower the heat when the temperature reaches 290 degrees to slow the cooking because at this point it will quickly reach 300 degrees.Add the butter, salt, and cinnamon; stir carefully and quickly to thoroughly mix. Be careful, the sugar is extremely hot and will burn your skin if you touch it. Add the baking soda and stir quickly to thoroughly mix, about 20 seconds; the mixture will immediately start foaming and turn lighter in color and increasing in volume.After you have stirred in the baking soda, and while the mixture is still foaming, immediately pour the brittle onto the prepared baking pan. Do not scrape out the pan as separated ingredients will mar the top of the brittle. Using a lightly buttered heavy spatula (a spatula that is not too flexible) quickly spread the brittle over the pan about  inch thick. Tip: You must work quickly because it takes less than a minute for the brittle to start cooling, once cooled it will be difficult to spread.Topping: Sprinkle the top of the brittle with kosher salt or sea salt.Tip: You can stretch the brittle a bit while it is still warm and pliable to make a thinner brittle. Wear rubber gloves so you dont burn your hands, lightly butter your fingertips, gently lift the edges and pull gently from the middle out to the edges. Pull all around the brittle to stretch to an even thickness. It the brittle is too hot to handle wait about 5 seconds and try again.Let the brittle cool completely, at least one hour and then break into pieces. Store in a tightly covered container at room temperature or refrigerate.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large, at least 2 quart-size, heavy-bottomed pan, combine granulated sugar, corn syrup, and water.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"granulated sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":19350,"name":"corn syrup","image":"corn-syrup.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"water.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, until the sugar is completely dissolved.

Tip: Lower the heat when the temperature reaches 290 degrees to slow the cooking because at this point it will quickly reach 300 degrees.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404732,"name":"wooden spoon","image":"wooden-spoon.jpg"},{"id":404789,"name":"kitchen thermometer","image":"food-thermometer.jpg"},{"id":404642,"name":"spatula","image":"spatula-or-turner.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"},{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add the butter, salt, and cinnamon; stir carefully and quickly to thoroughly mix.

Do not scrape out the pan as separated ingredients will mar the top of the brittle. Using a lightly buttered heavy spatula (a spatula that is not too flexible) quickly spread the brittle over the pan about  inch thick. Tip: You must work quickly because it takes less than a minute for the brittle to start cooling, once cooled it will be difficult to spread.Topping: Sprinkle the top of the brittle with kosher salt or sea salt.Tip: You can stretch the brittle a bit while it is still warm and pliable to make a thinner brittle. Wear rubber gloves so you dont burn your hands, lightly butter your fingertips, gently lift the edges and pull gently from the middle out to the edges. Pull all around the brittle to stretch to an even thickness.

or slightly stale challah bread. If your bread is fresh, you can take some of the moisture out by placing the slices on a baking sheet and putting them in a preheated 350 degree oven for 10 minutes, flipping the slices once halfway through cooking. This will dry the bread out a bit, which will help it soak up the moisture from the milk and egg mixture. If you don't have time for this step, no worries-- fresh bread will work too, it just won't soak up as much of the egg mixture.In a small saucepan, combine Kahlua Coconut Crme ingredients and whisk together until combined. Turn on the heat to medium and heat the mixture, stirring constantly, until it begins to boil around the edges. Stir constantly until the sauce has thickened to a cream-like consistency. Turn down the heat to low and reserve, stirring occasionally until ready to serve.In a blender, combine the non-dairy milk (or regular milk for dairy), eggs, flour, banana, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, salt and Kahlua. Blend for a few seconds till well mixed.Pour the liquid mixture into a shallow baking dish or pie plate.Soak your slices of challah in the liquid for about 60 seconds, turning once, till the bread is nicely saturated on both sides. This should be done in batches.Heat your skillet over medium and grease it with 2 tbsp vegan butter (or butter for dairy). Fry the toast in two batches of 6 slices each.Let the slices brown nicely on each side for 3-5 minutes. Keep the heat on medium (or a little lower) to make sure the toast cooks through but doesn't burn.When the first batch of toast is cooked, re-grease the pan with remaining 2 tbsp of vegan butter and fry the second batch.Plate the French toast and garnish with powdered sugar, using a mesh strainer to lightly and evenly powder the toast with sugar.

Carefully remove cake from the pan and garnish with crushed toasted hazelnuts and a beautiful fanned strawberry, if desired.

great choices for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Tramin Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

oregano, sherry vinegar, 2 large pinches of salt and a pinch of pepper. Slowly incorporate the canola oil to create an emulsion.                          For the asparagus: Place a rimmed baking sheet in the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.                          Toss the asparagus with the olive oil in a large bowl and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add the asparagus to the hot baking sheet and cook until tender, about 10 minutes.                          Transfer the asparagus to a serving platter. Drizzle with 1/3 cup of the orange citrus glaze and sprinkle with some orange zest. Reserve the remaining glaze for Roasted Chicken with Orange Glaze.                          For the orange citrus glaze: Whisk together the orange juice, orange zest, honey, oregano, sherry vinegar, 2 large pinches of salt and a pinch of pepper. Slowly incorporate the canola oil to create an emulsion. Yield: about 1 cup                          For the chicken: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil and set a rack over the sheet.                          Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel. Coat the chicken with the canola oil and generously sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place on the rack set over the baking sheet and roast in the oven until cooked through and the internal temperature is 165 degrees F, 40 to 50 minutes depending on the size of the chicken. In the last 10 minutes of cooking, brush the chicken with 2/3 cup of the orange citrus glaze in 5 minutes intervals. Let rest 5 to 10 minutes before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"For the asparagus","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Whisk together the orange juice, orange zest, honey, oregano, sherry vinegar, 2 large pinches of salt and a pinch of pepper.
