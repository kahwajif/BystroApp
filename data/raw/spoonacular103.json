To prepare the corn sticks, position the oven rack in the center position and preheat the oven to 425ºF (218°C).2. In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the butter with 1 teaspoon of the oil. Use a pastry brush to coat each corn stick pan well generously with the butter-oil mixture. Place the corn stick pan in the oven to heat while you mix the batter.3. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the buttermilk, egg, and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and use a large spoon to stir the batter slowly, just until the ingredients are combined. There will be some small lumps; that’s okay. No need to panic.4. Remove the corn stick pan from the oven and spoon about 2 tablespoons of the batter into each well. The batter should fill the well to the rim.5. Bake the corn sticks until the tops are lightly browned and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. If you peek at the bottom of the corn sticks, they will be browned. Let the corn sticks cool in the pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes (but no longer than that).6. Use a small, sharp knife and your fingers to loosen the edges of the corn sticks and carefully transfer the sticks from the pan to the rack. Do not turn the pan upside down to release the corn sticks because its weight may break them. Serve warm. (The corn sticks can be baked a day ahead, covered, and left at room temperature. To serve, preheat the oven to 275ºF (135°C) and reheat the corn sticks, uncovered, just until warmed through, about 10 minutes.)","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To prepare the corn sticks, position the oven rack in the center position and preheat the oven to 425ºF (218°C).","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":218,"unit":"Celsius"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the butter with 1 teaspoon of the oil.

The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.\n\nQuintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

Set aside.In a small saucepan, vigorously whisk together the agar, “milk,” and sugar until there are no lumps remaining. Set the pan over medium-low heat, and gently whisk until the mixture begins to bubble and thicken. Take the pan off the stove to stir in both the “sour cream” and coconut yogurt, mixing until smooth, and then return it to the heat very briefly. Cook the mixture just until bubbles begin to slowly break on the surface, whisking the whole time. Add in the rose water and vanilla, whisk to incorporate, and quickly transfer the contents of the saucepan to your prepared molds. Gently tap each one on the counter to knock out any air bubbles before smoothing out the tops with a spatula. Let cool completely at room temperature before thoroughly chilling.For the hibiscus sauce, plunk the tea bags into the water in a small saucepan. Place it on the stove over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Immediately turn off the heat and cover, allowing the tea to steep for 20 to 30 minutes. Once deeply rose red in hue, remove the tea bags and allow the excess liquid to drip out, but do not squeeze them- This will cloud the mixture. Separately, stir together the sugar, orange zest, and cornstarch until thoroughly combined, and add these dry goods into the saucepan. Return it to the heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved and the liquid bubbling and fully thickened. Let cool before chilling in the fridge.To make the almond brittle, begin by combining the sugar, water, corn syrup, cinnamon, and salt in a medium saucepan over moderate heat. Resist the urge to stir, and gently swirl the pan to mix the contents instead. Bring the mixture up to a boil, and continue to cool until the sugar caramelizes and turns a pale amber color. Meanwhile, set out a silpat or piece of parchment paper nearby where the brittle can come to rest. Once the sugar syrup has reached the right shade of golden brown, quickly stir in the sliced almonds to coat them evenly in the mixture, and waste no time in pouring everything onto your prepared silpat or parchment. Smooth out the brittle into as thin a layer as possible. Let cool completely before breaking it into pieces.To serve, spoon about 1/4 – 1/3 cup of the hibiscus sauce onto the plate, and turn out one panna cotta on top.

Place all the tomatoes in a large bowl and pour boiling water over the tomatoes and let them stand for about 1 minute. Then pour the boiling water off and place the tomatoes in a bowl filled with ice water. Another way I do it is to boil a large pot of water and drop a few of the tomatoes into the boiling water at a time for about 30 seconds, scooping out the tomatoes and placing them into a bowl filled with ice water.

Divide the seasoning mix evenly between the shrimp and peppers  cover each with half of the seasoning and toss well. Stick both in the fridge to marinate for 30 minutes.\nWhen youre ready to cook, heat a large nonstick skillet or pan over medium-high heat. I dont add any extra oil because there is often some residual from marinating, but add some if you feel you need it! Add the shrimp first (in one layer, so you might have to do it in batches) and cook until pink and opaque. Remove the shrimp and set it aside on a plate. Add the peppers and onions and cook them until softened and almost charred, about 5 to 6 minutes. Turn off the heat.\nAdd the shrimp back into the peppers and its ready!

Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. One wine you could try is Fonterutoli Chianti Classico.

Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8073684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Ffonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998%2F12434"}]},"instructions":"Heat the oil in large frying pan over medium heat.

Dont over process, or itll turn into nut butter! Press the date dough evenly along the bottom of the prepared pan.In the same food processor or high-powered blender (no need to wash between - I used my Vitamix, but most powerful blenders should do the job), combine all of the filling ingredients except for the matcha powder and freeze dried raspberries and blend for about 2 minutes, or until the mixture is silky smooth and creamy. Scrape down the sides as necessary. You may need to add a bit more coconut milk or lemon juice to get it to blend smoothly if your blender isnt super high-powered. Once its smooth, taste the mixture and adjust the sweetness/tartness levels, if desired.Remove 1 cup of the filling from the blender, and add the matcha powder to the remaining filling in the blender. Blend to combine, until smooth.Pour the matcha filling into the prepared pan over the crust. Smooth out the top and tap the pan hard against the counter a few times to release any air bubbles. Place in the freezer.Place the remaining cup of filling back to the now empty blender. Add the freeze-dried raspberries, and blend until theyre broken up and incorporated completely. Smooth the raspberry filling on top of the matcha layer and garnish with fresh and freeze-dried raspberries.Let set in the freezer for at least 3 hours or until completely firm. You can also store it in the refrigerator, but it will take longer to initially freeze.If storing in the freezer, let it thaw in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving or let thaw at room temperature for 15 minutes before serving. I recommend running your knife under hot water to warm it up before cutting the cheesecake with the still-hot (dried) knife.Store leftovers tightly wrapped in the freezer (3 months) or refrigerator (5 days).","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Grease a 6 springform pan with coconut oil, or line an 6 cake pan with strips of parchment paper for easy removal, and grease well with coconut oil.

In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, whisk together 1/3 cup room-temperature water, coconut milk, cilantro, fish sauce, ginger, garlic and pepper flakes.

Pat the fish dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Divide the cooled couscous evenly among each of the foil pieces, mounding it in the center of each piece. Place one fish fillet on top of the couscous and spoon about a tablespoon of the sauce over the top.Bring the long sides of the foil together and crimp down the entire length (see the pictures in the post) leaving as much headroom above the fish as possible. Fold in one of the short sides and crimp tightly; repeat with the other side.Place all of the foil packets on a large, rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate them and the remaining coconut sauce for up to 24 hours. To serve, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the rimmed baking sheet with the foil packets in the oven and bake for 18-20 minutes, until the fish is cooked through (and registers 140 degrees on an instant-read thermometer). Let the packets rest for about 5 minutes. Microwave the refrigerated coconut sauce for about a minute until warmed through. Stir in the rice vinegar. Transfer the fish packets to individual plates and open carefully to avoid any escaping steam. Slide the contents onto each plate.

Add the onions and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the minced garlic. Cook until fragrant, about a minute more.\nThen add the crushed tomatoes, oregano, red pepper flakes, and sugar. Bring to a simmer; reduce the heat to maintain the simmer. Cook, uncovered while you prepare the chicken (about 10 to 12 minutes).\n\nPreheat oven to 400°F.\n\nPound cutlets thin: Place the chicken cutlets one at a time between two layers of plastic wrap or wax paper. Use a meat hammer, mallet, rolling pin, or even a heavy empty wine bottle to pound or roll the chicken pieces to an even thickness of 1/4 to 1/2-inch. Sprinkle salt on both sides of the cutlets.\n\nPrepare breadcrumbs and eggs for dredging: In a shallow bowl (large enough to dredge the cutlets), mix together the breadcrumbs, 1/2 cup Parmesan, and pinch of salt. In separate shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs.\n\nDredge cutlets and brown them: Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium-high heat until the oil is shimmering (not smoking) and a piece of breading dropped into it sizzles.\nWorking one cutlet at a time, dip the chicken cutlet into the egg mixture and then into the breadcrumbs. Working in batches as to not crowd the pan, place the dredged cutlets into the pan.\nLower the heat to medium and gently fry the chicken cutlets until they are golden brown on each side, about 3 to 4 minutes per side.\n\nPrep the chicken for the oven: Spread enough tomato sauce to thickly coat the bottom of a 9x13 casserole pan or baking dish. Once the cutlets are browned on both sides, arrange them on top of the tomato sauce in the baking dish.\nSpoon tomato sauce over each of the cutlets. Sprinkle the tops with sliced basil. Then lay slices of mozzarella over each cutlet and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese.\n\nBake: Bake in the oven at 400°F for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the mozzarella begins to brown.\n\nServe: Serve with pasta and the remaining sauce, or in a large roll.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Start the sauce","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat the olive oil in a saucepan on medium-high heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the onions and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add the minced garlic.
