Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                Crumble chorizo into a large skillet; add onion and green pepper.

Once thawed, cover with a slightly damp towel to keep pliable.Combine nuts in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped, adding the contents of the vanilla bean in two or three separate pulses. Once chopped, add nuts to a large bowl and combine with brown sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg and cloves, then thoroughly mix.Melt butter on the stovetop or in the microwave. Using a pastry brush, brush an entire 9x 13 pan with melted butter. Layer 8 sheets of phyllo dough – each one painted with melted butter – in the baking dish. Be very patient and gentle with the dough, and if it begins to rip, just try to push it into place. After layer 8, spread 1/4 of the nut mixture evenly over the dough. At this point, I wasn’t sure how the next sheet of phyllo would stick to the nuts, so I took my pastry brush and drizzled a bit of butter over the nuts. This helps!After the first layer of nuts, layer 4 sheets of phyllo on top – each one brushed with melted butter. Repeat this 3 more times: 1 layer of nuts, 4 sheets of phyllo, 1 layer of nuts, 4 sheets of phyllo, then a fourth layer of nuts. After that layer, add 8 sheets of phyllo on top (instead of just 4) like you did in the beginning, brushing each with melted butter. If there is any butter left, pour it over top. Stick the whole pan in the fridge and refrigerate for 30 minutes. As soon as you stick it in the fridge, preheat the oven.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove baklava from fridge and using a sharp knife, cut as desired. I set my pan down horizontally, then made four cuts from left to right. I then started in a corner and cut diagonals. Once cut, place pan in the oven and bake for 40 minutes. As soon as you place it in the oven, make your syrup below.If the top of the baklava gets to brown, tent it with aluminum foil. When finished baking, remove from oven and gently cut out a corner piece. Tilt the pan and if there is any butter laying, drain it. While the baklava is hot, evenly pour the syrup over top. Let set (ideally overnight, covered with aluminum foil once cool) before cutting and serving.To make syrup: Combine all ingredients together in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, and let cook for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool completely. Before drizzling, remove cinnamon stick.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Thaw phyllo dough according to directions on package, then unroll.

aside. To the canister of a food processor or Vita-Mix (I used a food processor) add oats, dates, sunflower seed butter (I used Trader Joe's), agave, cinnamon, vanilla, and process until mixture comes together. Mixture will be dense and should form a big dough ball in the food processor; this is a good sign. The mixture should err on the side of being wet because 1 cup cereal will be stirred in by hand in the next step, absorbing some of the moisture. When squeezed between fingers, the mixture should hold it’s shape, not fall apart, nor be crumbly at all. If it crumbles or falls apart, it’s too dry and needs more moisture or a binding ingredient such as additional agave, sunflower seed butter, or dates to be added in order for it to come together. Conversely, add more oats if mixture seems very sloppy or wet, noting that 1 cup cereal will be stirred in next, absorbing some moisture. This is not an exact science and you may need to play with the ratios of wet and dry ingredients, but the goal is a mixture that can be packed into a pan, and when sliced, will hold it’s shape in bar form; it should be thick, moist, and dense. Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl and stir in the crispy rice cereal, slightly crushing it while folding it in with the spoon. Keep folding until all the cereal appears to disappear into the mixture. Firmly press mixture into an even flat layer in prepared pan and smooth it with a spatula; set pan aside. In a medium microwave-safe bowl, melt the chocolate chips on high power, about 1 minute. Stir until chips are melted and smooth, reheating in 10 to 15-second bursts until chocolate can be stirred smooth. Drizzle chocolate over the dough and place pan in the refrigerator to set up for at least 30 minutes before slicing and serving. Bars may be wrapped individually in plasticwrap or stored in an airtight container and kept at room temperature for up to 1 week, or stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 month, or can be frozen for up to 3 months.

Tip them into a 9-inch springform pan. Press the crumbs into the bottom of the pan to make an even base and put into the freezer while you make the filling. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put a kettle on to boil. Melt the chocolate either in a microwave or double boiler, and set aside to cool slightly. To make the filling, beat the cream cheese to soften it, and then add the sugar and custard powder, beating again to combine. Beat in the whole eggs and then the yolks and the sour cream. Finally, add the cocoa dissolved in hot water and the melted chocolate and mix to make a smooth batter. Take the springform pan out of the freezer and line the outside of the pan with a good layer of plastic wrap, and then another layer of strong foil over that. This will protect it from the water bath. Sit the springform pan in a roasting pan and pour the cheesecake filling into the springform pan. Fill the roasting pan with the just-boiled water from the kettle to come about halfway up the cake pan, and bake in the oven 50 minutes to 1 hour. The top of the cheesecake should be set, but the underneath should still have a wobble to it. Peel away the foil and plastic wrap and sit the cheesecake in its pan on a rack to cool. Put in the fridge once it is no longer hot and leave to set, covered with plastic, overnight. Let it lose its chill before unspringing the cheesecake to serve. To make the glaze, very gently melt the chopped chocolate, cream and corn syrup. When the chocolate has nearly melted, take it off the heat and whisk until smooth.

Scoop the flesh from 3 potatoes into a medium bowl, leaving a 1/4-inch-thick shell. Repeat with the remaining potato but discard the flesh. Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved bacon drippings and the warmed milk to the bowl and mash with a potato masher or fork until smooth. Stir in the cheese, scallions, parsley, chopped bacon, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.                          Season the inside of the potato skins with salt and pepper. Divide the filling among the skins, then press the back of a spoon down the center of the filling to create a long, deep well. Brush the outside of the skins with the remaining bacon drippings and transfer to the baking sheet.                          One at a time, crack an egg into a ramekin or teacup, then carefully pour into each potato (it's OK if some of the egg white overflows). Transfer to the oven and bake until the whites are set, 20 to 25 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and top with more scallions and the halved bacon strips.

You should have 16-18 crepes, if you’re using an 9-10 inch skillet.Mix the softened cream cheese, granulated sugar, vanilla and lemon zest.Melt the butter in a skillet on medium heat. Add the apples, brown sugar and lemon juice. Cook the apples on medium heat until the apples are softened, 5-10 minutes, depending on how thick or thin you cut the apples.

Add cold butter and toss to coat, using your fingers to work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles coarse crumbs. In a large glass measuring cup or another bowl, whisk together milk, heavy cream, Greek yogurt, vinegar and egg. Pour mixture over dry ingredients and stir using a rubber spatula just until moist. Pour the dough onto a well floured surface and knead lightly about 5-6 times. Roll the dough to a 1-inch thickness and use a 2-inch round cutter to cut out the biscuits. Press together the scraps and repeat, making about 8 biscuits. Place biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet and brush the tops with heavy cream. Place into oven and bake for 16-18 minutes, or until the tops are golden. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack. To make the gravy, heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onions and sausage and cook, stirring frequently, until the sausage has browned, about 5-10 minutes, making sure to crumble the meat as it cooks. Stir in flour and cayenne pepper until moistened, about 1 minute. Gradually stir in milk and heavy cream until the sauce has begun to thicken, about 1-2 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in the maple syrup and season with salt and pepper, to taste. To serve, split the biscuits in half and top with maple sausage gravy.

Blanc are great choices for Salmon. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. You could try Chehalem INOX Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442371,"title":"Chehalem INOX Chardonnay","description":"INOX® takes its name from the abbreviation of the French word for stainless steel, inoxydable. The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents. Very pleased.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442371-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.82,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.7673684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fchehalem-inox-chardonnay-2009%2F109305"}]},"instructions":"Combine all ingredients in medium bowl.

Add the yogurt mixture into the flour/butter mixture and gently fold it in, forming a shaggy dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Gently pat the dough together until it holds its shape and can be formed into a 3/4 inch-thick disc, being careful not to overwork the dough or knead it too much. Cut the disc into 8 equal triangles. Place each triangle on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush the top of each triangle with heavy cream. Bake 14-16 minutes or until golden on the edges and cooked through. Set aside to cool on a baking rack while you make the glaze. Whisk together the Greek yogurt, lime juice, and green food coloring, if using. Gradually add powdered sugar, whisking briskly until smooth, until you have a thick, but runny glaze. Drizzle the glaze over warm scones, then immediately sprinkle scones with toasted coconut.

Do not grease the baking sheets.In a small blender, blend together the Ener-G powder and warm water until its frothy.  Keep it aside.  I use the small jar of my Magic Bullet for this task.Measure the flours, baking soda and salt in a medium size bowl; stir it together and set it aside.In a large bowl, beat the peanut butter, margarine and sugars with an electric mixer until well combined.  Add the Ener-G mixture and vanilla extract and beat it well again.Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and stir by hand to incorporate it into the dough.  Alternatively you can use the electric mixer at low speed to do this.  Since I have used whole wheat pastry flour I did it by hand itself because I did not want it develop too much gluten.This cookie dough is dry and crumbly unlike the usual cookie doughs.  You will have to use your hands to mix it well.  About halfway through mixing, add the chocolate chips and stir until just blended.The way the dough ends up depends upon the type of peanut butter used.  So do as I did.  Test bake 2 cookies and decide what you have to do.  Shape the dough into balls and place at least an inch apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Flatten each one a little with the palm of your hand, so they’re more like little patties.  I pinched small pieces of dough and rolled between my palms; dampened my fingers with little water to enable easy flattening.  The patties were not smooth but had a couple of cracks.  That’s fine.Bake it for about 11-12 minutes, until just set.  I baked the first 2 cookies for 12 minutes and saw that the bottom had started turning dark brown.  Other than that I did not face any other problem with the dough being crumbly.  So proceeded with the rest of the dough too in the same manner but baked it for just 11 minutes.  Remove the baking sheet from the oven and cool it on a wire rack for 5 minutes so it will continue to bake and will set completely.

rosé. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. One wine you could try is Sanctuary Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 33 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":441958,"title":"Sanctuary Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir","description":"The wine at first has a light ruby color. It has aromas of black cherry/cherry and violets with the characteristic Bien Nacido dried herbs and light pepper spice balanced by the toasty oak spice and vanilla influence of French oak barrel aging. There are flavors of cherry and red berry with dried herbs followed by a light pepper spice. The sweet oak spice and vanilla is nicely balanced by the fruit flavors. The wine is concentrated and elegant with a rich mouthfeel and lingering finish.","price":"$33.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/441958-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":7,"score":0.7545454545454546,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fsanctuary-bien-nacido-vineyard-pinot-noir-2007%2F109741"}]},"instructions":"Add chicken, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, salt and pepper to taste, cream cheese, and water to crock pot.
