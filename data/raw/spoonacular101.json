the Cheddar crust1. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, combine the flours and salt. Cut the butter and lard into small pieces, add to the bowl and process 5 seconds.

With the motor running, pour in enough of the vinegar mixture in a slow, steady stream for the dough to form a ball; process for 10 to 15 seconds.3. Turn out the dough onto work surface. If it appears too dry, work in 1 to 2 more teaspoons water. Shape the dough into a 6-inch disk, wrap it in plastic, and chill at least 2 hours (or overnight) before using.Make the apple pie filling4. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).5. Peel, core, and cut the apples into 1/16-inch slices. Immediately toss the apple slices in a large bowl with the lemon juice to prevent them from turning brown.6. Whisk together the sugar, flour, cinnamon, and salt. Add this mixture to the apple slices and toss gently to coat evenly.Assemble the pie7. Divide the dough into 2 unequal pieces, one slightly larger than the other. (The slightly larger piece is for the top crust.) On a lightly floured work surface, roll the smaller piece into a round about 11 inches in diameter. Carefully transfer the dough round to an 8- or 9-inch pie plate and fill with the apple slices. Using your hands, shape the apples into a firmly packed mound slightly higher in the center than at the sides. Dot the apples with butter. Trim the edges of the bottom crust to a 1 1/2-inch overhang.8. Roll out the remaining dough into a 13-inch round, and carefully arrange it over the apple pie filling. Trim the edges of the top crust to a 1 1/2-inch overhang. Fold the top crust under the edge of the bottom crust, press together, and flute decoratively using your thumb and forefinger. Cut three 1 3/4-inch slashes in center of top crust to allow air to escape.9. Bake the pie for 20 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 375°F (190°C) and continue baking 30 to 40 minutes longer, or until the pastry is golden brown and the juices are bubbling. No more than 10 minutes before the end of baking, brush the Cheddar crust with the egg glaze and sprinkle with sugar.10.

tablespoons sugar over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until small bubbles appear around the edges. (The sugar helps to prevent the milk from scorching.) Remove from the heat, cover, and let steep until the vanilla infuses the milk, about 10 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean and return to a simmer. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl combine the remaining sugar, flour, and salt. Gradually stir in the warm milk. Return to the saucepan and cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until the mixture bubbles, then boil for an additional 2 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and gradually beat half of the milk mixture into the eggs. Scrape the egg mixture back into the saucepan, stirring constantly. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly until the mixture thickens or reaches 160°F, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and, if using, add the butter. Continue to whisk for about 20 seconds, then pour into a bowl. If using vanilla extract and/or rum, add it now. Press a piece of plastic wrap against the surface and let stand at room temperature until cool, about 1 hour. The custard can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Do not beat the cooled custard or it will break down.Position a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F (325°F for a convection oven). Grease two 9-inch round baking pans or one 9-inch springform pan, line the bottom with parchment paper or wax paper, grease again, and dust with flour.In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the butter, 1/4 cup milk, and vanilla.On low speed, blend together, about 30 seconds. Increase the speed to medium-high and continue beating for 2 minutes. Beat the egg with the remaining ½ cup milk. In 3 parts, beat the egg mixture into the flour mixture, about 20 seconds after each addition, until smooth.Divide the batter equally between the prepared pans. Bake until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean and the cake springs back when lightly touched, about 25 minutes for 2 pans or 30 to 40 minutes for a springform pan.  Let cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove the cake to a wire rack and let cool completely, at least 1½ hours. The cake can be wrapped and stored at room temperature for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.If using a springform pan, cut the cake horizontally in half. Place a cake layer on a serving plate, spread with the filling, and top with the second cake layer. Refrigerate while preparing the glaze.To make the glaze: In the top of a double boiler, combine the chocolate, sugar, and water and place over barely simmering water until melted. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and vanilla. Let stand, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 15 to 30 minutes.    Pour the glaze over the cake, allowing a little to drip over the sides. Refrigerate until chilled. Boston cream pie is best the day it is made, but can be covered and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Remove the cake from the refrigerator about 20 minutes before serving.Boston Cream Cupcakes: Divide the batter between 12 (2½-inch) cupcake tins, filling no more than three-quarters full, and bake at 350°F (325°F for a convection oven) for about 20 minutes. After cooling, cut horizontally in half, fill with the custard, and pour the glaze over top.Richer Cake: In the batter, substitute 3 large egg yolks for the egg and increase the butter to ½ cup (1 stick/4 ounces/115 grams) and the sugar to 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (8 ounces/225 grams). In the glaze, omit the sugar and water, increase the butter to ¼ cup (½ stick/2 ounces/55 grams), and add 1½ tablespoons light corn syrup.Decorated Top: Combine 1 cup confectioners' sugar, 1 tablespoon water, and 1 teaspoon light corn syrup. Spoon into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/8-inch round tip. After covering the cake with the chocolate glaze and before it sets, start from the center and pipe spiral rings. Using the tip of a knife or skewer and starting from the center, pull parallel lines outward to the edge.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a 2-quart heavy bottomed saucepan, heat the milk, vanilla bean, and 2 tablespoons sugar over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until small bubbles appear around the edges.

Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc.

For the Crumb Topping: Whisk the granulated sugar, dark brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and salt into the melted butter in a medium bowl to combine. Add the flour and stir with rubber spatula or wooden spoon until the mixture resembles thick, cohesive dough; set aside to cool to room temperature, at least 10 to 15 minutes.2. For the Rhubarb: Toss the rhubarb with the sugar, cornstarch, and ginger in a small bowl until evenly coated; set aside.3. For the Cake: Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees F. Spray an 8-inch square baking dish with nonstick cooking spray and line with parchment paper, pushing it into corners and up sides; allow excess to overhang edges of dish.4. With an electric mixer on low speed, mix the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt on low speed to combine. With the mixer running at low speed, add butter one piece at a time; continue beating until the mixture resembles moist crumbs, with no visible butter chunks remaining, 1 to 2 minutes. Add egg, yolk, vanilla, and buttermilk; beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 1 minute, scraping the bowl once if necessary.5. Use a slotted spoon to remove the rhubarb from the bowl where it will have released some juice. Add the drained rhubarb to a clean bowl. Toss the rhubarb with the 2 teaspoons of all-purpose flour, coating it evenly. Add the rhubarb to the cake batter and gently fold it into the batter using a rubber spatula.6. Transfer the batter to the prepared baking pan; using a rubber spatula, spread the batter into an even layer. Break apart the crumb topping into large pea-sized pieces and spread in even layer over batter, beginning with the edges and then working toward center. Bake until crumbs are golden and wooden skewer inserted into center of cake comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes. Cool on a wire rack at least 30 minutes. Remove cake from pan by lifting parchment overhang. Dust with powdered sugar just before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"For the Crumb Topping","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Whisk the granulated sugar, dark brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and salt into the melted butter in a medium bowl to combine.","ingredients":[{"id":10019334,"name":"dark brown sugar","image":"dark-brown-sugar.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"granulated sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":2010,"name":"cinnamon","image":"cinnamon.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the flour and stir with rubber spatula or wooden spoon until the mixture resembles thick, cohesive dough; set aside to cool to room temperature, at least 10 to 15 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404732,"name":"wooden spoon","image":"wooden-spoon.jpg"},{"id":404642,"name":"spatula","image":"spatula-or-turner.jpg"}],"length":{"number":10,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"For the Rhubarb: Toss the rhubarb with the sugar, cornstarch, and ginger in a small bowl until evenly coated; set aside.","ingredients":[{"id":20027,"name":"corn starch","image":"white-powder.jpg"},{"id":9307,"name":"rhubarb","image":"rhubarb.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"For the Cake: Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees F.

Using your hands mush it all together. If it is moist enough to knead into a ball it's great- if not, add some more liquid cheesecake until it's ready. Portion out 12-15 balls of the mixture- roll them together with your hands and set them aside on a cookie sheet.Melt the white chocolate and put it in a shallow bowl. Using a spoon, dip each ball of cake into the white chocolate and tap it on the side of the bowl until all the drips are off. (Christina says to do this with gloved hands, but I didn't have gloves so I used this method instead.) Then toss it in the milk crumb until well coated. Put them in the fridge for at least 5 minutes to fully set the chocolate. The truffles can be stored in an airtight container for unto a week in the fridge.Preheat oven to 350.Combine the butter and sugars in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and cream together on a medium-high for 2 to 3 mins. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the eggs, and mix on medium-high for 2 to 3 mins. Scrape down the sides of the bowl once more.On low speed, stream in the oil, Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and paddle for 4 to 6 mins, until the mixture is practically white, twice the size of your original fluffy butter/sugar mixture, and completely homogenous, with no streaks of fat. Don't rush the proces. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl.On low speed, add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Mix for 45-60 seconds, just until your batter comes together and any remnants of dry ingredients have been incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.Detach the paddle and remove the bowl from the mixer. Dump the shredded carrots into the bowl and, with a spatula, fold hem into the batter.Light coat a 9x13 pan with cooking spray and using a spatula, spread the batter in an even layer in the pan.Bake for 25-30 mins. The cake will rise and puff, doubling in size, but will remain slightly buttery and dense. At 25 minutes, gently poke the edge of the cake with your finger, if it bounces back slightly and isn't jiggly in the center, it's done. Leave it in for 3-5 more minutes if it isn't quite done.Cool the cake on a wire rack (or in the freezer.)Heat oven to 300 F. Put cream cheese into a medium sized bowl and using an electric mixer, beat on medium speed for 2 mins. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatual. Add the sugar and mix for 1-2 mins, until the sugar has been completely incorproated. Scraped down the sides of the bowl .Whish together the cornstarch and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk in the milk in a slow, steady stream, then whisk in the egg until the slurry is homogenous. (ps I love that she uses the word \"slurry\")With the mixer on a medium low speed stream in the egg slurry. Paddle for 3 or 4 minutes, until the mixture is smooth and loose.

Make the ham: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Mix the brown sugar and the remaining 2 tablespoons mustard with the reserved 1/2 cup rhubarb syrup in a bowl; set aside. Remove the skin and all but about 1/4 inch fat from the ham. Score the fat with a small sharp knife in a tight crosshatch pattern, making the cuts about 1/2 inch apart. Put the ham flat-side down on a rack in a roasting pan. Add 1 cup water to the pan and tent the ham with foil. Roast 1 1/2 hours.                          Increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Uncover the ham and brush with the rhubarb-mustard syrup. Continue roasting, brushing with more syrup every 15 minutes, until the ham is golden brown and glazed all over, about 1 1/2 more hours. Transfer to a platter; garnish with thyme sprigs.

Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8073684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Ffonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998%2F12434"}]},"instructions":"Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.

The yeast will dissolve and start to foam. Set aside until needed.In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attatchment or in a large bowl using a spoon, stir to combine milk, egg, olive oil, sugar and salt. Slowly pour the yeast mixture in and stir.Add the flour and Rosemary, stir until the mixture is combined. If using a stand mixer, switch to the kneading hook attachment and knead for 5 to 8 minutes on low until the dough has formed. It should still be tacky but smooth, add a touch more flour if too sticky. If you are not using a stand mixer, pour the dough onto a floured surface and knead the dough by hand for 5 to 8 minutes until the dough is smooth.Place the dough onto a surface, I used a cutting board. At this time line your slow cooker with parchment paper. I used 2 strips going both directions (see picture up above). Lightly spray the parchment paper with cooking spray or a sprinkling of cornmeal to prevent sticking. With a knife, slice the dough into 12 even pieces. Roll each piece into a ball with your hands and place in the slow-cooker on top of the parchment paper. If using a 6-quart slow-cooker, use all 12 rolls. If using a 4-quart slow-cooker, use 6 rolls and freeze the remaining for another use. The dough balls will touch, therefore when cooked they will be pull-apart rolls.  If you do not want them to touch, use less dough & leave a 1\" space in between rolls.Cover and cook on low for 1 hour to let the rolls rise. Then switch the heat to high and cook for 1 more hour. If using a 4-quart slow-cooker, check the rolls at 50 minutes. Remove the rolls by using the parchment paper to lift the rolls out of the slow-cooker. The rolls should be fluffy and cooked through. If you would like the rolls to be golden on top, remove them from the parchment paper onto a baking sheet and place under the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes until golden. Serve warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small bowl, stir to combine warm water and yeast. The yeast will dissolve and start to foam.

For the crepe batter: In a mixing bowl, beat together the milk and eggs. Whisk in the club soda and a pinch of salt. Gradually whisk in the flour and mix until just combined, then whisk in the melted butter. The mixture should be the consistency of really thin pancake batter. If it's a little thick, add a little more milk. Let the batter sit for at least 30 minutes before using. (HINT, HINT: Crepe batter can be made up to a couple days ahead and refrigerated.)                          For the cherry compote: In a medium saucepan, combine the cherries, granulated sugar, lemon zest and juice and 1/2 cup water. Bring the mixture to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cook until the cherries release their juices and the liquid concentrates and becomes slightly syrupy, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and reserve.                          For the filling: In a medium bowl, combine the mascarpone, chocolate chips, granulated sugar and cinnamon. Stir to combine and reserve.                          To make the crepes: In a small nonstick saute pan, melt 12 tablespoon butter over medium heat. Swirl the butter around to coat the bottom of the pan. Wipe out any excess with a paper towel, saving the paper towel to use again--you will.                          Slowly ladle 1 1/2 to 2 ounces of crepe batter into the pan, tipping and rolling the pan around to allow the batter to evenly coat the bottom. It will take a little practice to get the motion of the ocean, the correct temperature of the pan and the proper amount of batter. Even for an experienced crepe maker, it takes a couple tries to get into the groove. The first few crepes always get tossed--accept it and move on.                          When the edges of the crepe begin to pull away from the pan and the bottom begins to brown, turn over the crepe and cook for 1 more minute. Remove the crepe from the pan, let cool and set aside in a stack separated by layers of parchment paper to keep the crepes from sticking together.                          Repeat this process with the remaining batter, wiping the pan with the paper towel or adding more butter as needed--once you get into the swing of things it's fast and fun!                          To assemble: Place a couple tablespoons of the mascarpone filling in the middle of each crepe and spread the filling over half the crepe in an even layer. Roll around the filling to seal. Place 2 filled crepes on each serving plate and spoon the warm cherry compote over the top. Dust with powdered sugar and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"For the crepe batter: In a mixing bowl, beat together the milk and eggs.","ingredients":[{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"egg.png"},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"milk.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"mixing-bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Whisk in the club soda and a pinch of salt.

Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Chloe Pinot Grigio.

To make the Quick Pickled Vegetables: Combine vinegar, sugar and salt in a saucepan with the water; bring to a boil over high heat and stir to dissolve sugar. Add carrots, onions, and jalapeños, and reduce heat to medium-high. Simmer until carrots are just tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Pour into a bowl; let cool completely before covering and refrigerating.

Toss together cabbage and 1½ teaspoons salt in a medium bowl. Let sit 30 minutes.4. Heat grill (or grill pan) to high (if using a charcoal grill, coals are ready when you can hold your hand 5 inches above grill for just 2 to 3 seconds); lightly oil grates. Place fish, skin side up, on grill. Cook, without moving fish, until opaque throughout, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip, using two spatulas if necessary. Cook until fish flakes slightly when pressed in the center, 5 to 7 minutes more.5. Transfer fish to a serving platter; let cool slightly, then shred with a fork into bite-size pieces. Garnish platter with lime wedges and cilantro sprigs. Serve warm or at room temperature (within 1 hour).
