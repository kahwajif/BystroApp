Pour the marinade into a 1-gallon ziptop bag, add the London broil and turn to coat with the marinade. Refrigerate for 4 hours (or at least 1 hour if time is limited). Remove the steak from the fridge at least 30 minutes before grilling to remove the chill.                          Heat a cast-iron grill pan or outdoor grill on medium-high heat. Remove the London broil from the marinade, letting the excess drip off. Season the steak well with salt and pepper. Grill on each side for 10 to 12 minutes, a total of 24 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing across the grain.                          For the salad: Add the tomatoes, zucchini, red and yellow bell peppers and onions to a large rimmed baking sheet and add the olive oil. Sprinkle evenly with salt and pepper, tossing to coat all the veggies in the oil. Place in a grill basket and grill over medium high until tender and lightly charred, about 5 minutes per side. (If using an indoor grill pan, you will need to grill in 2 batches to avoid overcrowding the pan and steaming the veggies.)                          Remove the charred vegetables to a cutting board and let rest until cool enough to handle. Chop into bite-size pieces. Add the chopped vegetables, basil and arugula to a large bowl. Drizzle with the balsamic and a small drizzle of olive oil, season with some salt and pepper and toss it all together. Serve with the sliced steak.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"For the London broil","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Whisk together the molasses, vinegar, mustard, olive oil, rosemary, soy sauce and garlic in a 2-cup measuring cup.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":19304,"name":"molasses","image":"molasses.jpg"},{"id":2046,"name":"mustard","image":"regular-mustard.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404766,"name":"measuring cup","image":"measuring-cup.jpg"},{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Pour the marinade into a 1-gallon ziptop bag, add the London broil and turn to coat with the marinade.

paper or a silpat.Sift together almond flour, powdered sugar and pumpkin pie spice in a medium bowl and set aside. If a significant portion won’t go through your sifter (more than 2 tablespoons) you’ll need to grind them up until they do.*If you are using whole almonds, process the almonds and powdered sugar for about a minute in the bowl of a food processor. Take out the mixture and sift it, reserving whatever bits don’t pass through the sieve. Add these bits back to the food processor and run the machine for another minute. Sift again. You should have about 2 Tbsp of slightly chunkier almond bits, but just add those into the dry mix. Then sift in pumpkin pie spice.In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the egg whites, sugar and salt and turn the mixer to medium (4 on a Kitchen Aid). Whip for 3 minutes. They will not seem especially foamy at that point. Increase the speed to medium-high (7 on a Kitchen Aid) and whip another 3 minutes, then crank the speed to 8 for go another 3 minutes.Turn the mixer off and add in vanilla extract and whip for a final minute on the highest speed. At the end of this minute, you should have a very stiff, dry meringue.When you remove the whisk attachment, there will be a big clump of meringue in the center, just knock the whisk against the bowl to free it. If the meringue has not become stiff enough to clump inside the whisk, continue beating for another minute, or until it does so.Now dump in the dry ingredients all at once and fold them in with a rubber spatula. Use both a folding motion (to incorporate the dry ingredients) and a rubbing/smearing motion, to deflate the meringue against the side of the bowl. This should take about 30-45 turns/folds and should be lava like in texture – this enough to mound up on itself, but fluid enough to melt back down.Transfer about half the batter to a piping bag. Pipe the batter into circles on the baking sheet. Keep in mind batter will continue to spread just a bit. Refill the piping bag after piping out half of macarons.After piping your macarons, take hold of the sheet pan and hit it hard against your counter three times, rotating 90 degrees after each tap.Bake for 18 minutes, or until you can cleanly peel the parchment paper away from a macaron. Let cool on the pans before peeling the macarons from the parchment.In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle, beat the butter and pumpkin at medium-high speed until smooth, about 20 seconds. Beat in extract, pumpkin pie spice and salt until well combined about 15 seconds.Add powdered sugar; beat at medium-low speed until most of the sugar is moistened, about 1 minute. Scrape down the bowl and add heavy cream. Beat at medium speed until incorporated, about 20 seconds, then increase speed to medium-high until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes, scraping down bowl once or twice.Match up macarons in pairs based on size and shape. Fill a pastry bag fitted with the buttercream and pipe a quarter sized mound of buttercream into half of the shells, then sandwich them with the other half.Macarons are best a day or so after making.

The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish.

Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Boil enough water in a pot to boil all of your beef. Once the water is boiling, add the beef. Let it come back up to a boil, and boil for 1 minute. Strain in a colander and rinse thoroughly with fresh water to remove any impurities.\nNext, in your instant pot, turn on the saute setting. Add the oil, crushed ginger, garlic, scallions, and onions in that order. Stir to lightly caramelize. Let the onion turn translucent. Add the tomato and dried chilies.\nNext, add the meat to the pot. Then add the tomato paste, spicy bean paste, sugar, soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine, and mix thoroughly.\nPour 8 cups of water into the instant pot. Add the spice packet. The instant pot should be filled to the 10-cup line; it shouldnt be more than  of the way full per safety instructions. Our instant pot is the largest size (8 quarts); if yours is smaller, you can halve the recipe accordingly.\nClose the lid of the instant pot, and make sure you have your vent set so it is not venting. Cook for 100 minutes on the aromatic meat stew setting. If you dont have an instant pot, you can use a regular pot on the stove, but instead, cook the soup on a low simmer for 3-4 hours.\nWhen the instant pot timer is up, carefully release the pressure valve (wear an oven mitt, so you dont scald yourself!). Boil some noodles per package instructions, and in the last minute or two of the noodles cooking, throw your bok choy in and blanch until just tender.\nServe each bowl of Taiwanese beef noodle soup with a serving of noodles, a few stalks of bok choy, and generous sprinklings of finely minced cilantro, scallions, and Chinese pickled mustard greens. Pro tip, buy the pre-seasoned spicy mustard greens and you can use them straight out of the package. If you are using the non-spicy version (from a can, for example), chop and saute with a little oil, a few chopped dried red chilies, and a pinch of sugar.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Boil enough water in a pot to boil all of your beef.

Position the racks in the oven into thirds and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Grease and flour three 9x2-inch round cake pans. Put two pans on one baking sheet and one on another.2. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, allspice and salt. In another bowl, stir together the carrots, chopped nuts, coconut and raisins.3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the sugar and oil together on medium speed until smooth. Add the eggs one by one, and continue to beat until the batter is even smoother. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture, mixing only until the dry ingredients disappear. Gently mix in the chunky ingredients. Divide the batter among the three baking pans.4. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the pans from top to bottom and front to back at the midway point, until a thin knife inserted into the centers comes out clean; the cakes will have just started to come away from the sides of the pans. Transfer the cakes to cooling racks and cool for about 5 minutes, then run a knife around the sides of the cakes and unmold them. Invert and cool to room temperature right side up. (The cakes can be wrapped airtight and kept at room temperature overnight or frozen for up to 2 months.)5. To make the frosting: Beat the cream cheese and butter together until smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sugar and continue to beat until the frosting is velvety smooth. Beat in the vanilla extract until well-combined.6. To assemble, stack the layers, spreading a generous amount of frosting between layers and then cover the top and sides. Garnish and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.*Note 1: If you like a substantial layer of frosting between layers, I would probably use 1.5 times the quantities in the frosting recipe. Too much frosting is always much better than not enough :)*Note 2: Covered, the cake will keep at room temperature for 2 to 3 days.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Position the racks in the oven into thirds and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
