Lightly spray with cooking spray. Fit a pastry bag with a 1/2-inch-round pastry tip.                          Whisk together the flour, confetti sprinkles, baking powder and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl.                          Combine the granulated sugar and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a handheld electric mixer). Beat on medium-high speed until well combined, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla and continue to beat until incorporated and pale, about 2 minutes. Adjust the speed to medium-low and add the flour mixture and milk in batches, beginning and ending with the flour. Continue to mix until smooth and well combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Transfer the batter to the prepared pastry bag.                          Pipe the dough over the circle patterns on the parchment paper. Refrigerate while the oil heats up.                          Fill a medium Dutch oven or pot with about 2 inches of oil and bring to 340 degrees F over medium heat. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Cut the parchment paper around each doughnut, leaving a border. Use the paper border to carefully place 2 doughnuts at a time into the oil face first, then carefully remove the paper with tongs. Fry the doughnuts until golden, turning, 1 1/2 minutes per side. Remove the doughnuts with a slotted spoon to the paper towels. Repeat with the remaining doughnuts. Cool completely. Store at room temperature in an airtight container up to a day in advance.                          For the chocolate frosting.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Place all ingredients in a blender or food processor.

In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish.

Place a rectangle of parchment paper in the bottom and spray again with non-stick spray.In a small glass bowl, combine the gelatin and  cup of water. Place the bowl over a small pot of water to create a double boiler (see photos below). Turn the heat to low and let the water/gelatin mixture heat and dissolve. Once the gelatin is dissolved, stir in the peppermint extract.In a medium pot, combine the granulated sugar, corn syrup and  cup of water. Attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pot. Bring the mixture up to a boil and let it simmer until it reaches 250 degrees (about 5-7 minutes).While you are waiting for the sugar mixture to come up to temp, whip the egg whites until stiff peaks have formed. Here is a video tutorial from Epicurious.com on how to whip egg whites.When the sugar mixture reaches 250 degrees, turn off the heat. Stir in the gelatin mixture. Because the molten sugar is much hotter than the boiling point of water, the hydrated gelatin will foam up quite a bit as you stir it into the hot sugar (this is the water instantly boiling). Stir it as it deflates.With your mixer on high, slowly pour the sugar/gelatin mixture into the beaten egg whites. You want to pour the hot liquid in a thin stream as you beat it into the fluffy egg whites. This is where it is nice to have a helper. The pot will be heavy and you will have to hold it up for a long time as you pour slowly. You need a LARGE bowl for this. The mixture grows as you beat in the molten sugar!Once all of the sugar gelatin mixture is mixed into the egg whites, continue to beat until the mixture just begins to set (the beaters will begin to leave a trail in the top of the marshmallow mixture). Immediately pour the mixture into the prepared pan. Squirt red food coloring over the top and use a toothpick or chopstick to drag the color through, creating swirl marks.Let the marshmallows sit at room temperature for at least 3 hours to allow them to set. Once they have set, transfer them to a cutting board. Using a pizza cutter or kitchen shears, cut into squares. Coat the utensil with non-stick spray to keep it from sticking. Dust the marshmallows in a mixture of corn starch and powdered sugar to keep them from sticking to each other.

Add remaining pork and onions and cook, stirring frequently and scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan, until onions are softened, about 4 minutes. Add cumin and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 minute.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Add chicken stock and pureed chilies to pot and stir to combine.

Blanc are my top picks for Salmon. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. One wine you could try is NV Mindbender Chardonnay. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 12 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428583,"title":"NV Mindbender Chardonnay","description":"Lightly Oaked, the Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal.

                                  To make the chocolate mint thumbprints:  Melt the dark chocolate and mint chocolate together in a microwave or over a double boiler.

Add the granulated and brown sugars and beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg yolks and vanilla and beat again until combined. Scrape the chocolate into the mixer and beat just until incorporated. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and add the flour mixture all at once. Beat on low speed, scraping the side of the bowl occasionally, until the dough is smooth. Transfer it to a sheet of plastic wrap and pat it into a disk; wrap and refrigerate it until it is chilled and firm, at least 30 minutes.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Preheat the oven to 350°F.

Roll each ball in the coarse sugar and place it on a prepared baking sheet. Use your thumb or a small dowel to make an indentation in the center of the cookie. Bake for 10 minutes, remove the sheet from the oven, and use your thumb or the dowel to make the indentation more visible. Return the sheets to the oven and bake for another 4 to 5 minutes.(These are the type of cookies that can overbake very quickly—pull them out at the first signs of cracking.) Set the baking sheets on a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes. Use a spatula to transfer the cookies to the rack to cool completely before filling them.                                                                                                                             7                                                                            To make the white chocolate filling:  Place the white chocolate in a glass measuring cup with a pour spout. Put the cream in a microwave-safe bowl or cup and microwave it on high power until it boils, about 30 seconds. Pour the hot cream over the white chocolate and let stand for 30 seconds, then whisk until smooth. Stir in the peppermint extract. Fill the thumbprint cookies with the white chocolate ganache and refrigerate them until set, about 30 minutes. Note: These cookies taste great at room temperature or directly from the refrigerator. They can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the chocolate mint thumbprints:  Melt the dark chocolate and mint chocolate together in a microwave or over a double boiler.","ingredients":[{"id":1002064,"name":"chocolate mint","image":"mint.jpg"},{"id":19904,"name":"dark chocolate","image":"dark-chocolate-pieces.jpg"},{"id":2064,"name":"mint","image":"mint.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404699,"name":"double boiler","image":"double-boiler.jpg"},{"id":404762,"name":"microwave","image":"microwave.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Whisk until smooth, then set aside to cool.  ","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt.
