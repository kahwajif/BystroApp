Sleepy Hollow consistently produces Chardonnay with intense tropical fruit character, which exhibits both richness and finesse. Sleepy Hollow Chardonnay is considered by many as one of the quality standards for California Chardonnay. Vineyard Manager and Winemaker Sam Balderas keeps yields low to increase concentration and minimizes the handling of the wine to preserve the fruit's natural essence. This wine is 100% barrel fermented in French Oak and aged on the yeast lees to impart a rich, toasty, complex character to the wine. \n\nTasting Notes for this Vintage\nConcentrated rich flavors of tropical fruit marry with mineral elements and French oak accents. A typically high level of acid produces a long, clean finish. Our signature Chardonnay, this wine can be cellared up to nine years and improves with age.

The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.\nThis wine has a broad range of food pairings, whether alone with some well chosen cheeses, richer fish preparations or a good old steak on the barbeque.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438099-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":8,"score":0.82,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fdutton-goldfield-dutton-ranch-pinot-noir-2014%2F154141"}]},"instructions":"Rinse the rice until the water runs clear.

can be paired with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio. It has 4.2 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 14 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":436696,"title":"Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio","description":"Light green lustres run through the radiant straw-yellow color of this wine, whose aroma is rich in fruits, the most striking of which are pears and apples.

Remove the leaves from the rosemary and... place on the baking sheet.Drizzle the oil over the vegetable mixture, give it a generous sprinkling of salt and black pepper, and toss it around with your hands to coat everything. Spread them out evenly and roast for 20 minutes, stirring it around halfway through.While the vegetables are roasting, cut the bacon into 1-inch pieces and cook in a large soup pot over medium heat until crispy to your liking. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside.Add 1/2 cup of the beef broth to the skillet and stir it around to remove the browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Add the remaining broth and bring to a simmer. Add the dried mushrooms to the pot and cook for 2-3 minutes or until they puff up and soften. Add the roasted vegetables and the almond milk. Simmer for 15 minutes.Blend the soup by using an immersion blender or working in batches with a blender. Return soup to the stove and add vinegar, aminos, and salt and pepper, to taste. Because I make my own broth and don't salt it, I added about 2 1/2 teaspoons of Kosher salt. You don't need that much if you're using store-bought broth.Serve with bacon bits and cheese crisps.To make the cheese crisps, put a several thin slices of cheese in a skillet and cook over medium-high heat. They'll melt, then get bubbly for a while and render off some of its fat, then you'll be able to flip it like a pancake.
