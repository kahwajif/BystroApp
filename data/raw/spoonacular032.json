Roll several leaves at a time—similar to a chiffonade technique–and cut into about 1-inch strips. Doesn’t have to be exact, but try to keep the pieces relatively consistent in size.Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Add all of the collard greens and blanch for two minutes. Drain in a large colander and allow to cool down completely.Meanwhile, begin to cook the soft polenta using the instructions below. **Important Note:Be sure to have collard green filling completely ready by the time the polenta is finished cooking, as you want to assemble the dish right away at that point).If baking immediately, preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.Once the collard greens are cool to the touch, using your hands, grab a handful of a time and over the sink, squeeze repeatedly to remove excess moisture—set aside on a large cutting board. Repeat with remaining collard greens.Chop all of the collard greens, going back and forth with your knife repeatedly until consistent in size. Set aside in a large bowl.Combine collard greens with ricotta, lemon zest, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, 3 tablespoons of parmesan cheese, and all but 3 tablespoons of the grated cheddar and mix well with a large spoon. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.Lightly butter a 9 inch x 13 inch baking dish (similiar dimensions will also work). Spoon half of the batch of soft polenta into the baking dish and spread out with an offset spatula to make a thin layer. Spoon the collard green mixture evenly over the surface and again, lightly spread out with the spatula. Top with the remaining soft polenta and spread to smooth the surface.

Remove from oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.Add liquid to a medium-sized saucepan (4 quarts or larger) and bring to a boil. Add the salt and stir with a spoon.Slowly pour in the polenta, in a steady fine stream, into the boiling liquid, stirring continuously with a stiff, metal whisk or wooden spoon.Whisk continuously for an additional three minutes, until the polenta begins to slightly thicken.Turn down the heat to a low simmer and cook for an additional 40-45 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes or so, until the polenta is cooked completely. Depending on your stove, check regularly to ensure that the polenta is not sticking to the bottom of the pan.If the polenta gets too thick or difficult to stir, add a small amount of water at a time (you may need to add up to an additional cup of liquid) to thin it down.Once the polenta is completely cooked, stir in the butter and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Remove the bacon to a bowl, leaving as much fat as possible in the bottom of the pan.Add the onions to the pan and cook until gently browned, about 4 minutes. Add the rice and fry for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add white wine and stir well. Sprinkle in salt and pepper.Turn the heat to low and add a ladleful of hot chicken stock to the rice. Stir constantly until the liquid is fully absorbed. When rice has soaked up all the liquid, add another ladle of stock and again stir until all of the liquid is absorbed. It's important to stir constantly while adding the hot stock - this constant agitation prevents burning and allows the rice to release its starch.Keep adding stock one ladleful at a time, stirring until it's completely absorbed. Continue until the pot of stock is empty. The rice should be tender but firm to the bite, without any crunch in the middle of the grains. If you run out of stock before the risotto is done, you can finish with hot water. Add the water just like you did with the stock, one ladleful at a time.Once the risotto is tender, stir in the peas, lemon zest, and rosemary. Cook for 1 minute, or until the peas warm through.

Add egg, milk, and vanilla; beat until well combined.In a medium bowl, mix together flour, baking soda, and salt. Add flour mixture to butter mixture. Mix until just combine.Scoop half of the batter into the prepared baking dish. Coat a rubber spatula with non-stick cooking spray and press batter evenly around the bottom of the baking dish. Reapply cooking spray to the spatula as needed – the batter is thick and a bit sticky. Top the batter with caramel pieces, spreading them evenly around the dish. Sprinkle pecan pieces over caramels. Place large dollops of the remaining batter around the dish. Spray the spatula again and press the batter around the dish covering the caramels and pecans as best you can.Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until edges are golden brown and top is set. Remove from oven. The top of the blondies will be quite soft. Allow to cool for 10 minutes.Using foil to lift, remove blondies from the pan. Peel the foil back from edges, and slide blondies off the foil completely.

sauce and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Mix together 1/3 cup water, the remaining 4 teaspoons of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon rice wine and 2 teaspoons cornstarch, the sugar and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a small bowl until dissolved; set aside.                          Place the sauce, vegetables and chicken near the stove. Heat 2 tablespoons of the peanut oil in a large wok or large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; swirl to coat the wok. Once the oil is hot, scoop the chicken from the bowl with a slotted spoon, letting any excess coating remain in the bowl, and add to the oil. Stir-fry, breaking the chicken up just enough so it doesn't clump, until the outside coating is set and lightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the chicken with a slotted spoon and set aside. Wipe the wok out if needed.                          Return the wok to medium-high heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the wok. Just as the oil begins to smoke, add the ginger and stir-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the scallion whites and peppers and stir-fry until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Add the corn and stir-fry until just soft, about 1 minute. Add the chicken and the sauce (stir the sauce before adding); stir until the sauce is thick and the vegetables and chicken are cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the scallion greens.
