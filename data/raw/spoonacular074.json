Gruener Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Chehalem INOX Chardonnay with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442371,"title":"Chehalem INOX Chardonnay","description":"INOX® takes its name from the abbreviation of the French word for stainless steel, inoxydable. The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

Put the gelatine in a small bowl of very cold water to soften.\nLine a large sieve with muslin or a J-cloth, place over a bowl and pour in the rhubarb liquid, then leave to drip through. Once all the liquid has dripped through, return the juice to the pan over a low heat. If your rhubarb juice isnt very pink, you can add a drop of food colouring. Once soft, remove the gelatine from the water and squeeze out any excess, then add to the warm rhubarb juice, stirring until the gelatine dissolves. Pour half the rhubarb liquid into your jelly mould and put in the fridge to set for 3 hrs. Leave the remaining rhubarb juice at room temperature.\nMeanwhile, make the custard layer. Put the milk, cream, and vanilla pod and seeds in a pan, heat gently until just simmering, then remove from the heat. Soak the gelatine in a bowl of very cold water. In a large bowl, whisk the sugar, egg yolks and custard powder until smooth and pale. Pour over the warmed milk, whisking to combine. Pour the hot mixture into the pan and heat gently until thickened slightly, then remove from the heat. Remove the gelatine leaves from the water, squeeze out any excess liquid, add to the custard and stir well. Leave to cool.\nOnce the first layer of jelly has set, pour over half the cooled custard layer. Chill for a further 3 hrs.\nRepeat the process with the remaining jelly, making sure each layer is well set before you add the next. If the jelly starts to set at room temperature, you can reheat it very gently on the hob  just make sure it doesnt boil, as this will stop the gelatine from setting.

d'oeuvre"],"diets":["gluten free"],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"For the Cake LayersI recommend making the cake twice instead of doubling the recipe. While you're measuring out the ingredients for the cake, just measure out enough for the second batch at the same time so it's easier the second time around.The first time through, leave one layer white. Add a few drops food coloring to the second layer prior to baking (I used 5 drops in my lightest layer).When making the third and fourth layers, add a bit more food coloring to each layer such that you'll have gradually darker layers (I used 9 and 18 drops for my darker layers).Allow all layers to cool completely.For the Passion Fruit CurdIn a saucepan, whisk the sugar and cornstarch.Whisk in the passion fruit nectar, egg yolks and vanilla seeds and cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until thick, 6 minutes.Remove from the heat; whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until incorporated.Scrape the filling into a glass bowl, press a sheet of plastic wrap on the surface and refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours.For the FrostingPut the chopped white chocolate into a small bowl. Heat the chocolate in 30 second increments in the microwave set to 60% power. Stir after each increment, and continue to heat 30 seconds at a time, until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Set aside and allow to completely cool.Once white chocolate has cooled, sift the salt and powdered sugar over the butter, in a large bowl. Cream the butter and sugar mixture together until light and fluffy, scraping the sides of the bowl as needed.Measure the whipping cream into a cup, and stir in the vanilla extract.With the mixer running on low speed, gradually pour the cream mixture the bowl.Once the cream mixture has been incorporated into the frosting, fold on the melted (but cooled) white chocolate until incorporated.Increase the mixer speed to medium-high, and beat frosting for an additional 3 minutes.To Assemble the CakeOnce all of the cake layers have cooled, level each of the layers except the white layer.Place a small amount of frosting on a cake board to stabilize the cake. Center the darkest layer on the cake board. Pipe a small ring around the edge of the cake layer. This will ensure the filling doesn't spill out between the layers.Spoon a heaping 1/3 cup filling into center of cake and spread to the edges.Stack the next lighter cake on top and continue the process until all layers are stacked and the white layer is on top.Frost the cake with a crumb coat and chill in the fridge for at least an hour.To Decorate the CakePlace ~3/4 cup of frosting into two separate bowls (you'll have three bowls of frosting at this point, two with 3/4 cup, and one with the rest, which will be more than 3/4 cup).The bowl with the most frosting will be your lightest color. Add food coloring to that bowl first until the desired color is reached. Color the other two bowls of frosting such that you have three shades of frosting.Alternatively, leave all of the frosting one color.Place the cake on a rotating cake stand. Starting at the bottom, pipe a row of roses along the cake using the darkest frosting color.

Add the grated carrot and stir to combine. Season with salt and reserve.                          Combine the remaining sugar and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan.

Heat an outdoor grill or large cast-iron grill over medium-high heat. Whisk together the 1/4 cup sauce and the oil and brush liberally all over the pork chops. Place the pork chops on the grill and cook until the pork is warmed through and charred on both sides, about 5 minutes total. The pork chops might stick a bit to the grill but that is okay - just use a pair of tongs to gently pull away as needed. Transfer to a cutting board and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Cut each pork chop off the bone and thinly slice against the grain.                          To serve, divide the rice among 4 large bowls. Toss the carrots with the cilantro.

Fill a large pot with 3 quarts of water and add the Old Bay seasoning and 1 tablespoon of salt. Bring to a boil, add the shrimp, lower the heat, and simmer for 3 minutes, until just firm. With a skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer the shrimp to a large bowl. Leave 2 cups of the poaching liquid in the pot and discard the rest.                          Add the wine to the poaching liquid and bring to a boil. Add the scallops, lower the heat, and simmer for 2 minutes, until just cooked. With the skimmer, transfer the scallops to the bowl with the shrimp. Bring the poaching liquid back to a boil, add the calamari, and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, until just cooked. Be careful not to overcook any of the seafood or it will be tough! With the skimmer, transfer the calamari to the bowl.                          Bring the poaching liquid to a boil again, add the mussels, cover, and simmer for 4 to 5 minutes, until all the shells have opened, discarding any that don't open. Turn off the heat and set aside until the mussels in the broth are cool enough to handle. Remove the mussels from the shells and add to the bowl. Add 12 of the shells to the seafood and discard the rest. Set aside 1/2 cup of the poaching liquid, discarding the rest. Drain the seafood in a colander and put it all back into the bowl.                          For the dressing, heat the olive oil in a medium (10-inch) saute pan over medium heat. Add the garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook for 1 minute. (Be careful: Overcooked garlic will be bitter.) Add the tomatoes and cook over medium heat for 2 more minutes. Add the reserved poaching liquid, the limoncello, lemon zest, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and cook for 1 more minute. Pour the sauce over the seafood and toss gently. Add the fennel and parsley. Cut a lemon in half lengthwise, cut it thinly crosswise, and add it to the salad. Toss gently to combine and cover with plastic wrap. Chill for at least 3 hours or overnight.                          To serve, sprinkle with 2 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, and the juice of the remaining lemon.

In a small glass bowl, combine the warm milk, yeast, flour, and sugar and stir to blend. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside for 30 minutes.Make the panettone dough2. Place the pistachios on a baking sheet and spray them with water, sprinkle with a pinch or two of salt, and toast for 10 minutes, watching to make sure they do not burn. Cool completely and chop coarsely.3. In a bowl, combine the 1 teaspoon salt, the flour, lemon and orange zests, candied orange and lemon peel, if using, cranberries, pistachios, rum, and vanilla.4. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium speed for 2 minutes or until fluffy. Add the eggs and yolks and beat well. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture, mixing just until combined. Gradually add the starter and continue to beat on low speed until all ingredients are incorporated. The dough should not be sticky or too firm. It should look buttery and a little ragged.5. Turn out the dough onto a floured work surface and knead for 1 to 2 minutes, pushing the dough away from you with the heels of your hands, and then folding it back over on itself. The dough will be smooth and satiny.6. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place for about 2 hours, or until doubled in size. Gently turn out the dough onto a work surface and divide it into 4 equal pieces, if making smaller loaves, or into 2 pieces if making larger loaves; keep as much air in the dough as possible. Let the pieces rest, covered with a clean dish towel, for 10 minutes.7. For the smaller panettone, butter four 1-pound coffee cans or other deep molds that are 4 to 5 inches wide. Use 2-pound coffee cans to make two large panettone. Shape each piece into a smooth ball and place the dough in the mold. It should fill half the mold.8. Beat the reserved egg whites and brush the tops of the loaves. Cover and let the loaves rise for 1 hour, or until just slightly less than doubled. (The dough may be active and rise quickly, so you may not need the full hour.)9. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).10. Uncover the panettone, place the molds on the middle rack of the oven, and reduce the heat to 350°F (175°C). Bake for 30 to 35 minutes for the smaller molds and up to 45 minutes for the larger molds. (If, after 20 minutes of baking, the top of the panettone is taking on too much color, cover loosely with a piece of aluminum foil.) The bread is done when a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool for 15 minutes, then carefully remove the loaves from the cans and place the panettone on wire racks to cool completely. Panettone will keep fresh for up to a week in a plastic bag; freeze them for up to 6 months.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the starter","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"In a small glass bowl, combine the warm milk, yeast, flour, and sugar and stir to blend.

Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                Scrub and pierce sweet potato; place on a microwave-safe plate.

Using the tines of a fork, prick the top of the pastry all over. Cover the pastry with parchment paper and place another baking sheet on top. Bake for 25 minutes until golden. Remove the top baking sheet and parchment paper. Set aside.While the puff pastry is baking combine the tuna (if there is a lot of oil in the can drain some of it off. I left about a tablespoon of oil. I think it helps add flavor and keep things moist), sun-dried tomatoes, kalamata olives and garlic and mix to break up the tuna and combine the ingredients. Add the red wine vinegar, greek yogurt, dill, oregano and parsley. Mix to fully combine. To assemble the Napoleons: Place 4 pieces pastry on a work surface. Spread each piece with a little tzatiziki and a sprinkle of feta (I actually ended up mixing the feta into the tzatiziki), Cover that with spinach and then a layer of the tuna mixture. and top with a few slices of avocado.

Set aside.Place the ball of dough on a lightly floured surface, and using a rolling pin, roll it into a circle that's about 1/8-inch thick. The dough will be very hard, so it's best to first beat it down with a rolling pin (as if you were making puff pastry). It will loosen up as it comes to room temperature.Immediately brush the rolled out dough with one-fourth of the melted butter and sprinkle it with one-fourth of the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Sprinkle one-fourth of the chocolate onto the dough, pressing it lightly into the dough.Cut the dough into 12 wedges.Roll each wedge up, starting from the thickest end, until you form a crescent shape.Repeat the rolling, topping and shaping process with the other three pieces of dough.Place the rugelach on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and refrigerate it for 30 minutes. (You can also freeze the rugelach at this point for later use.)Bake the rugelach in a 350ºF oven for 18 to 20 minutes until golden brown.

Start off by cooking the quinoa. Add ½ cup uncooked quinoa to a sauce pan with 1 cup of water. Add 1 teaspoon each of sea salt and black pepper. Bring the quinoa to a boil and then reduce it to a simmer. Cover with a lid and stir every 4-5 minutes. Quinoa only takes 15-20 minutes to cook. Once it’s finished, allow it to cool.2.  If you’re using a flax egg, now’s a good time to get that started. Combine 1 Tablespoon of ground flax and 3 Tablespoons of water in a small bowl. Use a fork to whisk it together. Refrigerate until it is needed.3.  Preheat the oven to 350°. If you’re using frozen peas, set them out to thaw. Chop the greens and grate the zucchini.4.  In the meantime, food process or blend two cups of oats to create oat flour. Remeasure the flour – making sure it’s still 2 cups – and empty it into a large bowl. Add the quinoa and mix it together.5.  In another bowl, combine the liquid ingredients, including the flax egg, and seasonings. Stir together with a fork and then pour the liquid into the bowl of dry ingredients. Finally, add the zucchini, peas, spinach, and nutritional yeast and combine.
