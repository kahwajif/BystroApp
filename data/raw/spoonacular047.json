sauce pot, place vegetable oil and sliced shallots at room temperature. This is very important, if the shallots are placed into hot oil they will easily burn. Place onto stove and cook over medium heat. Allow the oil and shallots to slowly heat up until the oil starts bubbling, this takes quite some time, but you need to keep your eye on it. Once the oil bubbles, take a wooden spoon and keep the shallots in motion. Once the shallots turn golden brown, immediately remove and place into a large bowl lined with paper towel. It is normal for the shallots to turn a shade darker, even out of the oil. Set aside.In a large heavy sauce pot, brown the pork. When the pork is about half-cooked and most of the moisture has rendered out of the meat leaving you with a good amount of natural juices, add the bean paste, soy sauce, sugar and Coca-Cola.When all the ingredients have been incorporated, turn the heat to low and allow the sauce to reduce by 15-20%, about 20 to 25 minutes. Once the sauce has reduced, add in all of the crispy shallots you cooked the day before. The shallots will absorb any leftover liquid from the sauce. Your sauce is done!In another sauce pot, melt the butter and add the panko bread crumbs. Stir until the bread crumbs have turned golden brown.  Toast your slider bun with a piece of cheddar cheese.

water just until outer leaves pull away easily from head. Set aside 10 large leaves for rolls. (Refrigerate remaining cabbage for another use.) Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the barley, garlic, onion, soy sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, ginger, salt and pepper.

Cut out the thick vein from the bottom of each leaf, making a V-shaped cut. Place about 1/2 cup pork mixture on a cabbage leaf; overlap cut ends of leaf. Fold in sides.

about 95 degrees F). Pour the warm milk into the bowl of a stand electric mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment and manually stir in the sugar and yeast. Cover with a towel and let stand until the yeast is foamy, about 5-10 minutes. Add the softened butter, eggs, and salt. Scrape down the sides and manually stir as needed. Gradually add the flour and beat at medium speed until a soft dough forms. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until the dough is soft and supple, about 10 minutes longer. *If you do not have a stand-mixer with a hook attachment, knead the dough by hand in this step.Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it with your hands for about 2 minutes. Form the dough into a ball and transfer it to a lightly greased bowl. Cover the dough and let sit in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours.Line the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish with parchment paper,leaving room on the sides. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and, using a rolling in, roll into a 10x24 inch rectangle. I used a ruler for accuracy. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick, even at the corners.Make The Filling: In a medium bowl, toss the frozen raspberries with the sugar and cornstarch. Spread the cold sugared raspberries evenly over the dough. Tightly roll up the dough to form a 24-inch-long log. Cut into 16 even rolls (about 1.5 inches in width each). Arrange them in the prepared baking pan, cut sides up. Cover the rolls and let them rise in a warm place until they are puffy, about 2 hours. The berries will release their juice at the bottom of the pan - this is OK.Preheat the oven to 400F degrees. Cover the rolls with aluminum foil and bake for about 25 minutes, until they are golden and the berries are bubbling. Transfer the pan to a rack to cool for about 15 minutes.Make The Glaze: In a small bowl, whisk the confectioner’s sugar and heavy cream until smooth. Add more sugar or cream, depending how thick you want the glaze. Pour glaze over the rolls and serve warm.Make Ahead: During the second rise, cover the sliced rolls and let sit overnight at room temperature before baking.   Baked rolls can be frozen up to 2 months and warmed up to enjoy at a later date.  Glaze right before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make The Dough: In a small saucepan, warm the milk over low heat until lukewarm (no need to use a thermometer, but to be precise: about 95 degrees F).","ingredients":[{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"milk.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404789,"name":"kitchen thermometer","image":"food-thermometer.jpg"},{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Pour the warm milk into the bowl of a stand electric mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment and manually stir in the sugar and yeast.

The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.
