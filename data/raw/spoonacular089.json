The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.\n\nQuintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents. Very pleased.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442371-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.82,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.7673684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fchehalem-inox-chardonnay-2009%2F109305"}]},"instructions":"InstructionsCut your wings through the joint if whole, to separate the wing from the drumette.

It can burn easily if you don't watch it. Stir the coconut halfway through to prevent the bottom form burning. Transfer to a plate to cool.For the cake: Grease the same baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Stir in the milk and cocoa powder. Bring to a light simmer and then remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Slowly add the butter mixture to the flour mixture and stir until combined. Stir in the sour cream, eggs, and vanilla. Add the coconut and stir just until combined. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Directions\n                                \n                                        \n                                            In a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain.

Quickly add the milk and heavy whipping cream, continuing to whisk over medium-low heat. Add the cornstarch 1 tablespoon at a time and whisk until dissolved. Switch to a wooden spoon and stir constantly. Once the pudding starts to thicken, continue cooking for another couple of minutes until it is bubbling slightly.Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Strain the pudding through a fine sieve into the pie crust. This is optional, but helps strain out any lumps. Immediately cover the top of the pie with plastic wrap (directly on the surface of the pudding) and poke a few holes with a toothpick. Allow it to cool on the counter for at least 1 hour before refrigerating. Refrigerate for 4-6 hours or until the filling is firm before adding the topping. (Overnight is fine.)Make the topping by beating the heavy whipping cream on high speed with the whisk attachment until its bubbly, then add the powdered sugar and vanilla and beat until stiff peaks form.

This balances at a very high level. For all the dry extract-laden fruit here there is a wealth of acidity and tannin that are actually the dominant forces in the wine and ensure that this is a focused, smart and incredibly delicious Pinot Noir.

Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8073684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Ffonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998%2F12434"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 420 degrees Fahrenheit with racks in the upper third and lower third of the oven. Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper for easier cleanup (I used one large half-sheet for the butternut and a smaller quarter-sheet for the croutons).Roast the squash: On one of your lined baking sheets, toss the cubed butternut in enough olive oil to lightly coat all sides. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and arrange the butternut in a single layer. Roast on the lower third rack until the butternut is tender throughout and caramelized on the edges, about 35 to 40 minutes, tossing at the 20 minute mark when you add the croutons during step 4.Prepare the croutons: On your other baking sheet, combine the cubed bread with the seeds and salt. Drizzle on 2 tablespoons olive oil and toss to lightly coat the bread. Don't worry about trying to get the seeds to stick to the bread, just try to make sure they're lightly coated in oil. Arrange the mixture in a single layer so no croutons are on top of one another.Once you have tossed the butternut and placed it back on the lower rack, place the sheet of croutons on the upper rack. Toast the bread for 10 to 13 minutes, until the edges are golden. Remove the croutons from the oven and check the squashit will probably need 5 to 10 more minutes before the edges are caramelized. Once the butternut is done, remove the pan from the oven and set it aside to cool.To prepare the vinaigrette: Whisk together all of the ingredients until emulsified.To prepare the kale: Transfer the chopped kale to a big salad bowl. Sprinkle a small pinch of sea salt over the kale and massage the leaves with your hands by lightly scrunching big handfuls at a time, until the leaves are darker in color and fragrant, about 30 seconds.Final assembly: Add the grated cheese, cranberries and shallot to the bowl. Drizzle enough dressing into the bowl to lightly coat the leaves (you might not need all of it), then toss to coat. Add the roasted butternut and croutons and gently toss to combine. Drizzle in extra dressing if the salad seems like it needs it. For best flavor, let the salad rest for 10 minutes before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 420 degrees Fahrenheit with racks in the upper third and lower third of the oven.
