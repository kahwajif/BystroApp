Stir in yeast. Let stand until foamy, 5-10 minutes. In the bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with a hook attachment, place 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil and salt.  Mix on low speed until blended.  Add yeast mixture and mix on medium speed until dough begins to come together.  Gradually add remaining flour until the flour is fully incorporated and begins to and pull away from sides of bowl.  (Note: if the dough becomes too dry, add more water by the tablespoon until it is moist enough.)  Turn the mixer on and allow the dough to knead for 5-6 more minutes until smooth.  The dough shouldnt be sticky by the end of this time period.  Brush large bowl with oil and form the dough into ball. Place the dough into the bowl and turn it to coat with oil.  Cover with plastic wrap and allow it to sit in a warm place for one hour, or until doubled in size.  Place pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven with a rack positioned near the bottom of the oven.   Preheat oven to 500F.  Punch the dough down slightly, place it on a floured surface and roll out into the pizza shape you desire.  Lightly brush the dough with olive oil if desired and place in the preheated oven for 5-6 minutes, just until lightly browned.While the dough is pre-baking, add the avocado, Greek yogurt, jalapeno pepper, cilantro, garlic, lime juice and olive oil into a small food processor.  Process until the mixture is smooth.  Stir in cumin, chili powder, cayenne, oregano and paprika and season to taste with salt and pepper.  to assemble the flatbread:Remove from oven and spread the avocado sauce onto the dough in a thin layer.  Then add the tomato slices, green peppers, green onion, black beans, jalapeno, cilantro and then top with cheeses.Bake in the preheated oven for another 12-14 minutes, until cheese is melted and browned and the vegetables are tender.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"to make the flatbread dough:Stir the warm water and honey in small bowl.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9-inch round springform pan; set aside.2. Make the Crust: Process the cookies and sugar in a food processor until ground into fine crumbs. Add the melted butter and pulse until the mixture is evenly moistened. (If you do not have a food processor, you can place the cookies in a zip-top bag and crush into crumbs with a rolling pin, then transfer to a bowl and stir in the sugar and melted butter.) Press the crumb mixture evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake until the crust is set, about 8 minutes. Set on a cooling rack while the filling is prepared.3. Make the Filling: Place the chopped chocolate in a metal bowl and set over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Heat, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth. Remove bowl from the saucepan and allow chocolate to cool to room temperature. 4. Meanwhile, using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the cream cheese, sugar and cocoa powder together until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl before adding another. Add the cooled, melted chocolate and beat until just combined. Using a rubber spatula to give it a final mix (the batter will be on the thick side) and pour the filling over the crust, smoothing the top into an even layer.5. Bake until the center just barely wiggles when moved and the top looks dry, about 1 hour. Cool for 5 minutes, then run a thin knife between the cake and the sides of the pan to loosen. Transfer the cheesecake to the refrigerator and chill, uncovered, overnight. 6. Make the Cherry Topping: Drain off ¼ cup of juice from the thawed cherries and set aside. In a medium saucepan, combine the cherries (and any remaining juice), sugar and salt over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until it reaches a boil, about 5 to 10 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together the reserved cherry juice and cornstarch, and add it to the cherry mixture. Stir constantly until thickened, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature, then transfer to an airtight container and chill until ready to use, at least 1 hour. 7. Make the Whipped Cream: On medium speed, beat the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla extract in a mixer with the whisk attachment until smooth and completely combined, about 3 minutes. Slowly add the heavy cream, scrape the sides of the bowl, then increase speed to medium-high and whip until stiff peaks form.8. Finish the Cheesecake: When ready to serve, remove the sides of the springform pan and place the cheesecake on a serving platter. Using a pastry bag with a decorating tip, pipe a border of whipped cream around the top edge of the cheesecake. Spoon the cherry pie filling into the center. Garnish with chocolate shavings, if desired. Leftover cheesecake can be stored, tightly wrapped, in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
