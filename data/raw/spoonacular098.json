Prepare the cheesecake layer: Preheat the oven to 325dgF. Place a large roasting pan on the lower third rack of the oven. Place a kettle of water on the stove to boil. Spray a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick spray and line the bottom with a round of parchment paper. Wrap a double layer of heavy duty foil around the bottom and up the sides of the pan (you want to seal it so the water from the water bath doesn’t seep into the pan).In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to blend the cream cheese until it is smooth and creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Mix in the sugar and salt and blend for 2 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl to make sure all is mixed in. Add the eggs, one at a time, blending after each addition. Finally, mix in the sour cream, whipping cream and vanilla (and food color, if using). Mix until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Set the pan into the roasting pan in the pre-heated oven. Carefully pour the hot water from your kettle into the roasting pan. Pour enough water so that there is about an inch of water coming up the foil along the sides of the cheesecake pan. Bake the cheesecake for 45 minutes. It should be set to the touch and not jiggly. Remove the cheesecake from the roasting pan and let it cool on a wire rack for at least an hour. When it has cooled, place the pan into the freezer and let the cheesecake freeze completely (4 to 5 hours or overnight).2.  Prepare the cake layers: Preheat the oven to 350dgF. Spray two 9-inch round pans with nonstick spray and line each pan with a round of parchment paper (see *Tips).  In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder and salt.  In a large bowl, combine the oil and sugar together and beat with an electric mixer for 2 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, and the vanilla, and beat for an additional 2 minutes.In a small bowl, combine the vinegar and baking soda and stir to dissolve. Add the vinegar to the bowl, along with the buttermilk and food coloring. Beat on medium-low speed for 1 minute, until blended. Add the dry ingredients and increase speed to medium-high, scraping down the sides of the bowl while mixing, for 2 additional minutes.  Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached. Let the cakes cool for 20 minutes. Run a knife along the edge of the pans, then invert the cakes onto a rack to cool completely.3.  Prepare the frosting: In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, combine the cream cheese and butter and beat until creamy and smooth. Add the marshmallow creme and mix until smooth. Add in the powdered sugar (and food color, if using) and continue to beat, scraping down the sides of the bowl, until all of the ingredients are mixed in and the frosting is smooth and spreadable.4.  Assemble the cake: Place one cake layer into the center of a cake plate or platter. Remove the cheesecake from the freezer, take off the sides of the pan, and slide a knife under the parchment to remove the cheesecake from the pan. Peel off the parchment. Trim the cheesecake, as needed to match the size of your cake layers (see *Tips). Place the cheesecake layer on top of the first cake layer. Place the second cake layer on top of the cheesecake.5.  Frost the cake: Apply a crumb coat layer of frosting to the cake (see *Tips), and refrigerate the cake for 30 minutes, or until the frosting is set. Apply the second layer of frosting. Add a large scoop of frosting onto the top of the cake. Use a long, thin spatula or knife to spread the frosting evenly across the top and then spread it down the sides of the cake too. Decorate, as desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare the cheesecake layer: Preheat the oven to 325dgF.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place a large roasting pan on the lower third rack of the oven.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404629,"name":"roasting pan","image":"roasting-pan.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Place a kettle of water on the stove to boil.

Combine 2 quarts of the water with remaining brine ingredients in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring until the salt and sugar have dissolved completely. Transfer the mixture to a large pot (at least 5-gallon capacity) and add the remaining 4 quarts of water. Let cool completely. Its essential that you let the brine cool completely before adding the turkey for food safety reasons.2. Lower the turkey, breast first, into the brine. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours. 3. Remove the bird from the brine and pat it dry with paper towels. Let it stand at room temperature for 2 hours. Meanwhile, discard the brine. 4. Preheat the oven to 425F (220C) with the rack in the lowest position. Prepare the cheesecloth by stirring together the melted butter and wine in a medium bowl. Fold a very large piece of cheesecloth into quarters so that its large enough to cover breast and halfway down sides of turkey. Immerse the cloth in butter mixture and let it soak.Make the chestnut stuffing5. Spread the bread cubes in a single layer on several baking sheets. Let the cubes dry uncovered overnight at room temperature. (You could also dry them in a 300 [150C] oven for 20 to 30 minutes, if necessary.)6. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Score the chestnuts on the bottom with an X, then boil them until soft, about 20 minutes. Drain and let cool slightly, then peel and quarter them.7. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the sage and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup of the stock and cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Transfer the onion mixture to a large bowl. Add the remaining 4 1/2 cups of stock, the reserved chestnuts and bread cubes, and the parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste and toss to combine.Stuff and roast the turkey8. Place the turkey, breast side up, on a rack set in a large roasting pan. Fold the wing tips underneath the body, as if the turkey was placing its arms behind its head, and season the cavity with 1 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. If youre stuffing the turkey, loosely fill the cavity with the stuffing. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine. Fill the neck cavity loosely with stuffing, and fold the neck flap under, securing it with toothpicks. If youre not stuffing the turkey, transfer the stuffing, or rather, dressing, to a buttered 17-by-12-inch baking dish. Cover it with parchment-lined foil and bake at 350F (175C) for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and continue baking until heated through and the top is golden brown, 30 minutes more. 9. Pat the turkey dry and rub it all over with softened butter and generously season it with salt and pepper. Remove the cheesecloth from the butter mixture, squeezing it gently over the bowl to remove any excess. Reserve the butter mixture for brushing and place the cheesecloth over the turkey breast. (The legs may be exposed; this is okay.) Place the turkey, legs first, in the oven and roast for 30 minutes, then brush the cheesecloth and exposed turkey parts with the butter mixture and reduce the temperature to 350F (175C). Continue roasting, brushing every 30 minutes, for 1 1/2 hours more. If the bird appears to be browning too quickly, you may need to tent it with foil. Discard the cheesecloth and rotate the pan. Baste the turkey with the pan juices and continue to roast, rotating the pan halfway through, until the skin is golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thigh (avoiding bone) registers 165F (74C). This will take 1 to 2 hours more, depending on the size and temperature of your bird. Its best to start taking the turkeys temperature after 2 1/2 hours total cooking time.10. To serve, transfer the turkey to a platter and garnish it with the apples, sage, and chestnuts, if desired. Let the turkey stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before carving. Set the pan with the drippings aside for making gravy, if desired. Make the gravy11. Trim the fat and membranes from the giblets. Rinse the giblets and pat them dry. 12. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook the celery, carrot, leek, and onion, stirring fairly often, until the vegetables begin to brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the giblets, neck, herbs, peppercorns, and the water. Cover and bring to boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook, uncovered, until reduced to about 3 cups, 50 to 60 minutes. Pour the mixture through a fine sieve into a clean medium saucepan and keep it warm over medium-low heat. Roughly chop the giblets and shred the meat from the neck with a fork. Discard any other solids.13. To deglaze the roasting pan, place the reserved roasting pan over two burners. Add the wine and bring it to a boil, stirring with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits on bottom of pan. Remove from the heat.14. Heat the reserved 3 tablespoons of pan drippings in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour, whisking briskly but constantly to combine, then continue to cook, still whisking constantly, until the mixture is fragrant and a deep golden brown, about 9 minutes.

It is a \"seamless wine\" achieved by selecting the best grapes of Brolio, matured in barriques, with a long fining in the bottle that enhances its noble elegance. Sangiovese with a small amount of Cabernet Sauvignon and MerlotWith this harvest, it was finally possible for the Sangiovese to express itsmaximum potential. Intense ruby color with garnet tinges, it has a beautifularomatic complex bouquet.

Cook until nice and crispy! Using a slotted spoon, remove crispy bacon pieces to a paper towel lined plate (leaving the bacon drippings in the pan). Add the onions and saute for 5-7 minutes (will soften and begin to get golden). Next, add the garlic, cherries, and rosemary and saute, stirring constantly, for another 30-45 seconds.

combined.  Pour in remaining half and half and heavy cream and heat over medium low heat, stirring frequently until it comes to a small simmer. Turn off the heat. In a separate bowl, whisk egg yolks until pale yellow.  Slowly incorporate granulated sugar until mixture thickens slightly to create ribbons that fall back on itself. Take about 1 cup of the hot milk mixture and whisk it into the eggs to temper. Whisk in another cup, then stir the tempered eggs into the pot. Heat over low heat stirring frequently until mixture reaches 175 degrees. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Strain into a bowl sitting on ice {to cool the mixture quickly}. Refrigerate 24 hours.For the nougat:Melt butter in a small saucepan. Stir in sugar and evaporated milk and cook over medium heat to melt. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer lightly for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in remaining ingredients. Pour onto a parchment paper lined plate or baking sheet. Cool 1-2 hours, then cut into small bite-sized pieces.For the caramel sauce:Place sugar and water into a small saucepan and bring to simmer. Mixture will stay white, then become clear as the sugar melts, then start turning amber in color. Once it turns a light amber, reduce heat and whisk in heavy cream. It will bubble violently at first, but keep whisking and it will all melt together to become a sauce. Stir in butter and vanilla. Pour into a bowl and cool to room temperature.To make the ice cream:Pour chilled chocolate ice cream base into a frozen bowl of ice cream maker and churn 7-10 minutes until smooth and frozen {like soft serve}. Scoop half of the mixture into a large Tupperware container. Top with half the nougat pieces, half the peanuts, half the chopped chocolate and half the caramel sauce.

First, make the pizza dough. In a glass measuring cup or small bowl, combine yeast and 1 cup warm water. Add a pinch of sugar and let sit for 5 minutes.2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the flour and salt. Mix the ingredients until combined.3. Add the yeast mixture to the flour mixture. Next, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Mix until combined. Switch to the dough hook and knead for about 5 minutes on medium speed.4. Spray a large bowl with cooking spray. Form dough into a ball and place in the bowl. Cover pizza dough with a damp towel and set in a warm area to rise. Let the dough rise for 1 hour or until dough has doubled in size.5. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Cut the dough in half. Take one piece of dough and punch it down on a lightly floured surface. You can refrigerate or freeze the other half of the dough or make 2 pizzas, if you wish. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out into a circle. Place the pizza dough on a pizza pan or pizza stone. 6. Evenly brush the olive oil on the pizza. Top with fresh mozzarella slices. Add the parmesan cheese. Place the pizza in the oven and bake for 12-15 minutes or until pizza crust is golden and cheese is melted.7. Remove the pizza from the oven and place arugula on top. Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the arugula and season with salt and black pepper, to taste. Garnish with additional parmesan cheese, if desired. Cut into slices and serve.Note-we made a thin crust pizza. Josh rolled the crust into about a 13-inch circle.

In a heavy bottomed pot, cook 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the pancetta over medium heat, stirring, until the pancetta is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the onion, garlic and red pepper and cook, stirring, until the veggies are softened, about 5 minutes. Push the veggies off to the side of the pan and increase the heat to medium-high. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the center of the pan and crumble in the ground sausage, ground chicken or ground beef. Cook without stirring for 3 minutes and then begin breaking up the meat and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned, about 5 minutes. Add the oregano, basil, parsley and thyme. Cook another minute or so.Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 cups water, 1 cup milk, bay leaf, salt and pepper to the pot. Cover the pot and simmer the sauce, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 2-3 hours. If the sauce seems too watery after 2 hours remove the lid and simmer until thickened. Discard the bay leaf, taste to season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat. At this point the sauce can be placed in the fridge overnight or up to 3 days. You may also freeze the sauce.When you are ready to assemble the lasagna, make the pasta dough. To make the dough using a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook (my preferred method) add the flour and eggs to the bowl. Knead the dough on medium speed until the dough comes together and forms a ball. If your dough seems too dry add water a teaspoon at a time, being careful not to add too much water. I typically have to add 4-6 teaspoons of water, but live in a very dry climate. The dough should be moist, but not too sticky. If you add too much water just add a teaspoon of flour at a time to balance it out. Divide the dough into four balls and place each ball in a sandwich bag. Set aside.To make the dough by hand, mound the flour on a work surface; make a well in the center. Crack the eggs into the center and beat with a fork. Gradually mix the eggs into the flour. Using a bench scraper, mix in the last of the flour until the dough comes together. Scrape the surface clean and dust with flour. Knead the dough, dusting with flour, until firm and smooth, about 8 minutes. Shape into a ball.Quarter the dough and shape into 4 balls. Place each ball in a sandwich bag. Set aside.Now make the Bchamel Sauce. Melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, whisking constantly, for 1 minute. Whisk in the milk in a steady stream. Add the nutmeg and simmer for 2 minutes, whisking. Remove from the heat, stir in provolone and parmesan and season with salt and pepper. Let cool, stirring occasionally to prevent a skin from forming.To assemble the lasagna grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. If baking the lasagna right away Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Spoon a little of the red sauce over the bottom of the dish. Grab 1 ball of pasta dough and flatten the dough. Lightly dust the dough with flour, brushing off excess. Set a pasta machine to the widest setting; run the dough through. Fold the dough into thirds like a letter, then run it through again, short end first. Run it through 2 more times, dusting with flour if it seems too sticky. Now switch to the 2nd setting and roll all the dough sheets through the machine again. Switch to the 3rd setting and roll the sheets through again. Switch to the 4th setting and roll the sheets through again. Now switch to the 5th setting and roll the sheet through the machine one last time. All machines vary, but I find I like the 5th setting for lasagna sheets. Generally, when you see your hand through the pasta sheet, it's thin enough to cut.Cut the sheet of dough to fit inside your dish. I can normally get 2 long and wide noodles + enough extra dough on the ends to fully make one layer of pasta cover the bottom of the pan. If this is not the case just form the extra dough into a ball and roll it out again. Fit into the pan where it is needed.Now spoon about 1/2 of the remaining red sauce over the noodles. Drizzle about 1/3 of the Bchamel on top of that.Grab another dough ball of pasta and roll it out just as you did above. Layer the pasta over the Bchamel. Now add the remaining red sauce and another 1/3 of the Bchamel. Roll out another ball of dough and layer the pasta. Add the remaining 1 cup of provolone cheese and the mozzarella cheese. Roll out the last ball of dough and layer it over the cheese layer. Pour the remaining Bchamel over the noodles and then sprinkle with a little shredded provolone and mozzarella.Spray a piece of foil with cooking spray and cover the the lasagna. At this point the lasagna can be placed in the fridge for up to 3 days or frozen.Bake, covered for 1 hour and then uncovered for 15 minutes more. Let stand for 15-20 minutes before slicing. If your lasagna was cold bake, covered for 15-30 minutes longer.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Start by making the sauce.

Line a 15 x 10-inch jelly roll pan with parchment paper, leaving an extra 1-inch of parchment sticking up on both 15-inch sides of the pan so that you can easily lift the cake out after baking.  (If youd like the parchment to stick to the bottom of the pan more easily, sprinkle a little bit of water on the pan and then press the parchment paper on top of it.  You can also lightly mist the top of the parchment paper with cooking spray for easier cake release afterwards, although its not required.)\nWhisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, pumpkin pie spice and salt in a large mixing bowl until combined.\nIn a separate bowl, whisk eggs and granulated sugar for 1 minute until thick. Add in the vanilla and pumpkin, and whisk until just combined. Fold in the flour mixture with a rubber spatula, and stir together until just combined.\nSpread the batter evenly into prepared pan.  Bake for 13 to 15 minutes, or until top of cake springs back when touched. Carefully lift the parchment paper and cake out onto a flat (and heat-safe) surface.  Then slowly, use your hands to roll the cake  rolling from the short end to the short end  until it is completely rolled up.  Transfer the cake roll to a wire rack, and cool until it reaches room temperature.\nWhile the cake is cooling, make the cream cheese filling (see below).\nOnce the cake has reached room temperature, transfer the cake roll to a flat surface, and carefully it until it is flat again (or mostly flat, its ok if the ends curl up a bit). Spread the cream cheese mixture evenly over cake, leaving a 3/4-inch border on all sides.  Then carefully re-roll the cake, gently peeling away the parchment paper as you roll until you can completely remove and discard it. Tightly wrap the pumpkin roll in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least one hour.\nRemove and unwrap the pumpkin roll and transfer it to your serving dish. Lightly dust the pumpkin roll on all sides with powdered sugar, if you would like.  Then slice* and serve.\nIf you have leftovers, just re-wrap the pumpkin roll in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.  Or freeze for up to 3 months.\n\nTo Make The Cream Cheese Filling:\n\nWhisk together cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl until smooth. If the filling is too thin, add more powdered sugar. If it is too thick, add a half teaspoon or two of water.  (You want a medium consistency so that the filling is easy to spread, but not too warm or thin that it will ooze out of the cake when youre rolling it up.)","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To Make The Pumpkin","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]}]},{"name":"Roll","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 375 F.

fragrant, about 5 minutes. Transfer the seeds to a spice grinder and grind to a powder.                          Put the pork chunks through a sausage grinder into a bowl. Add the ground cumin and fennel and the chiles, sprinkle with salt and pepper and mix together. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours to allow the flavors to meld.                          Divide the pork mixture into sixteen 3-inch patties, each about 3 ounces. Wrap each patty in caul fat.                          Heat 2 tablespoons of canola oil in a large nonstick saute pan over high heat until it begins to shimmer.

Transfer the kale to the food processor and add the parsley, Parmesan, green onions, the remaining 1/4 cup oil and some salt and pepper and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a bowl.                          For the mash: Put the potatoes in a large saucepan, cover with cold water by 2 inches and add 2 tablespoons kosher salt. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 25 minutes.                          For the beer-mustard gravy: While the potatoes are cooking, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until soft. Add the flour and cook for 1 minute. Whisk in the beer and cook until completely reduced. Add the chicken stock, turn up the heat and cook, whisking occasionally, until thickened and the flour taste has been cooked out, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, whisk in the honey and mustard and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.                          Preheat the broiler.                          To finish the mash, drain the potatoes well, return them to the pan and return the pan to the burner to dry them out for a minute. Run the potatoes through a food mill set over a large bowl. Add the warm cream and butter and mix until smooth. Fold in the mascarpone and season with salt and pepper. Add some of the kale pesto and marble in until swirled.                          To finish the bangers: Top each of the patties with some of the grated Cheddar and place under the broiler until melted and bubbly.
