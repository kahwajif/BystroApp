Marinate at room temperature for about 15 minutes or in the fridge for 30 minutes or more.In a small bowl, whisk the egg white and cornstarch together until white and frothy. Add to the marinating chicken and combine well.Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or frying pan over medium-high heat. Add about a third of the chicken and stir fry until cooked through and golden brown on all sides (5-7 minutes). Transfer to an oven-safe dish and place in a warm 300 degree oven while the remaining chicken cooks.

Bring the lemon mixture to boil, then add the cornstarch-water mixture. Stir constantly until the sauce is smooth and thickens, about 2 minutes.Return the chicken to the pan and toss to coat with the sauce.Sprinkle chicken with toasted sesame seeds.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium-high.

Break the cardamom pods open using a mortar and pestle. Transfer the seeds to a food-processor bowl and discard the pods. Add the rest of the sauce ingredients and blitz to get a smooth, runny sauce.Prepare the vegetables2. There aren’t any strict rules you must follow, but try to keep them chunky and retain some of the natural shape of the vegetable, where possible. For example, cut round vegetables into thin wedges and long vegetables into batons or strips. Here are a few useful suggestions.•For cauliflower and broccoli, divide into medium florets•For beets, peel and cut into 1/8-inch-thick slices or wedges•For potatoes and sweet potatoes, leave the skin on and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices•For Jerusalem artichoke, carrot, parsnip, salsify, turnip and celeriac, peel and cut into 3/8-inch-thick sticks, not too perfect•For baby leeks, just trim off the green ends3. Before you start frying the vegetables, prepare a large plate lined with paper towels. Scatter some cornstarch for coating the vegetables on another plate. Place the batter ingredients – the flour, the 1/2 cup of cornstarch, sparkling water, grapeseed oil, and salt – in a bowl and whisk well to get a smooth, runny mix. Add some chile flakes for heat.4. Pour the frying oil in a medium saucepan and place on high heat. Once very hot, turn the heat down to medium. When frying the vegetables, the oil should be hot enough so you get a good sizzle but not so hot that they burn.5. Take each piece of vegetable and toss it in the cornstarch. Shake to remove any excess, then dip it in the batter. Lift and shake again, then carefully put into the oil. Deep-fry four or five pieces of vegetable at a time. As they fry, turn the pieces over to color evenly. Soft vegetables like leeks should take about 1 minute to cook, harder ones like beets 2 minutes or more. When frying, occasionally remove any burnt bits that float in the oil. As they cook, transfer the vegetables onto the paper towels and keep warm.6. When all the vegetables are cooked, serve them at once, with the dipping sauce on the side.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the dipping sauce","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Break the cardamom pods open using a mortar and pestle.","ingredients":[{"id":1002006,"name":"cardamom pods","image":"cardamom.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404751,"name":"mortar and pestle","image":"mortar-and-pestle.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Transfer the seeds to a food-processor bowl and discard the pods.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the rest of the sauce ingredients and blitz to get a smooth, runny sauce.Prepare the vegetables","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"There aren’t any strict rules you must follow, but try to keep them chunky and retain some of the natural shape of the vegetable, where possible.

Set aside.In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and powdered sugar with an electric mixer until fluffy.Add in the egg and vanilla, and beat to combine. Reduce the speed and gradually add the flour mixture, beating until the dough is just combined.Gather the dough and wrap it in plastic wrap, place in the refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably longer or overnight.Once the dough is chilled and ready, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Roll the dough on a sheet of parchment paper sprinkled with flour. Roll to 1/4 inch thickness. Place the parchment paper on a cookie sheet and freeze the entire thing for 15 minutes.Get another baking sheet and line that with parchment paper.Remove the dough from the freezer and begin to use your cookie cutter to cut the shapes. Place the cookies on the second baking sheet, about 1 inch apart from each other and place in the freezer for 15 minutes.After freezing again, bake the cookies for 8 minutes or until they feel crisp to the touch.Repeat the above steps until all the cookie dough has been used.Allow the cookies to cool completely on a wire rack before icing them.Combine the powdered sugar, meringue powder, and water in a mixing bowl and mix on low speed until the icing has a matte appearance, about 7-10 minutes.Slowly add in the copper or brown food coloring to get your desired color.Transfer some of the icing to a squeeze bottle and cover the remaining icing in the bowl with a damp washcloth. This is to prevent the icing from hardening.Begin to outline the edges of the mooses antlers. It is best to have your arm and hand resting comfortably on a table. Continue until all of the antlers are outlined.Clean the squeeze bottle as you will need it again.Now we want to use the icing to flood and color in the antlers. In order to do that, you will need to add more water to the icing so the consistency is thinner. Add 1/2 tsp of water at a time, stirring by hand, until the icing runs off the back of a spoon.Transfer some of the icing to the squeeze bottle. Begin to flood the inside of the antlers with icing, using a tooth pick to help spread the icing to the edges. You dont want to add too much icing, as this could cause the icing to overflow beyond the edges. Practice until you know how much icing you need. Immediately after flooding the antlers, add the gold sprinkles.Continue to flood and add sprinkles to all of the antlers.When all of the cookies are finished and set, store them in an air tight container.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a bowl combine the flour, cocoa, salt, and espresso.
