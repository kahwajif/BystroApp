The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.\n\nQuintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

Add shallot, garlic, thyme and the remaining  teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring constantly until fragrant and starting to brown, 20 to 45 seconds. Add mushrooms and rosemary and stir to coat with the shallot mixture. Cook, stirring often until the mushrooms have released their juices and the juices have evaporated and the mushrooms have started to brown, about 7 minutes.                      Add vermouth and pepper and cook, stirring until the liquid has evaporated, 1 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle flour over the mushroom mixture and stir to coat. Add broth and cook, stirring until the flour has dissolved into the broth. Increase heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer, stirring often until the sauce is thickened. Add the pork back to the skillet and turn to coat in the sauce. Heat the pork, turning often, in the sauce until it is hot and just barely pink in the center, 1  to 3 minutes. Transfer the pork to 4 plates. Stir the half and half into the gravy. Spoon the gravy over the pork chops.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pat pork dry with paper towels.

boiling.    Remove from heat, cover, and steep for fifteen minutes.    Using a sieve, remove the beans from the milk and set the milk aside. You will only need 1/4 cup plus two tablespoons of the milk, so it’s fine if some sticks to the beans during this process.    Preheat oven to 350 F.    In a medium-sized bowl, mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.    In a separate medium-sized bowl, beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy.    Add the egg to the butter/sugar mixture, mixing until fully incorporated.    Alternately mix the coffee-infused milk (you should have 1/4 cup plus two tablespoons of the milk to use) and dry ingredients into the butter/sugar bowl, mixing until just combined.    Methods 1 and 3: Fill cupcake liners 3/4 full.    Method 2: Drop a miniature homemade Krispy Kreme (or a piece of a doughnut that you cut to fit your cupcake liner) into each liner and top with batter until almost full.    Bake cupcakes for 20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out dry.    Method 1: Top with whipped cream or ice cream and put a fresh doughnut hole on top just before serving.    Method 2: Top with whipped cream or ice cream and dust with cinnamon.

Melt the butter in a skillet and saute the shrimp until just turning pink on both sides, but not curling tightly.  This should only take two minutes.  Put the shrimp and any juices in the bowl of a food processor and pulse the machine 12 times until the shrimp is well chopped, but hasn't turned to paste.  You want the mixture to retain some texture.Put the shrimp and all the rest of the ingredients (except the olive oil) into a bowl  and mix gently but thoroughly.  Using a 1/4 cup measure, form the mix into patties, gently pressing it together as you form them.  Coat each patty with more breadcrumbs, just pat them on with your hand if they are very delicate.  Set on a plate and cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for an hour or more to allow the patties to set up a bit.Coat the bottom of a skillet with olive oil and heat on medium high.  When the oil is hot, cook the shrimp cakes until they are golden on each side.  This should take about 5 minutes per side.  To make the salsa, trim the ends off the asparagus and blanch it in boiling water.  To do this, bring a pan of water to a boil, drop the asparagus in, and after about 30 seconds, take it out and plunge it into a bowl of ice water.  This takes the raw 'edge' off the asparagus and brightens the color.  DO NOT leave the asparagus in the boiling water any longer than 30 seconds, and do not wait for the water to come back to a boil or you will get limp asparagus.Pat the asparagus dry and chop it into very small slices.  Toss with the minced onion, bell pepper, lime juice, cilantro and salt and mix well.  Taste to adjust the seasonings.  Refrigerate until needed.Serve the shrimp cakes hot on a bed of lettuce, topped with the salsa.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Peel the shrimp and de-vein.

The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.\n\nQuintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.
