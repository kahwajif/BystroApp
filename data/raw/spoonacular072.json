Blanch broccoli quickly: if working on stovetop, bring a pot of water to a boil, dump broccoli florets and slices in, and let cook for a minute, no more than two. Drain water, and place broccoli in an ice bath. Allow to cool sufficiently. OR do what I do, and place one tablespoon of water at the bottom of the microwave-safe bowl with the broccoli.

Special equipment: latex or other thin food-safe gloves; tweezers, optional; an immersion blender, optional              Make the truffles: Put the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with an inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl with the chocolate over, but not touching, the water. Stir the chocolate occasionally until melted and smooth. (Alternatively, put the chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Melt at 50 percent power in the microwave until soft, about 1 minute. Stir, and continue to heat until completely melted, about 1 minute more.)                          Meanwhile, bring the cream and honey to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat (or in the microwave). Gradually whisk the cream into the chocolate until smooth and shiny. Whisk in the butter until very smooth. If possible, switch to an immersion blender and blend for about 1 minute for a satiny texture. Cover the surface of the chocolate with plastic wrap; chill in the refrigerator until firm, about 1 hour.                          Transfer 2 tablespoons of the chocolate mixture to a small resealable plastic bag and snip a tiny piece off one corner. Twist the top of the bag to push the chocolate mixture down to the cut corner. Set the prepared bag aside.                           Line a 13-by-9-inch baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop slightly rounded tablespoon-size portions from the remaining chilled chocolate mixture. With gloved hands, roll each portion into a ball. Refrigerate until set, about 15 minutes.                          Decorate the truffles: Let the truffles soften slightly at room temperature for about 10 minutes to make it easier to insert the almond slices. Using a tweezers if desired, gently insert a row of 8 almond slices pointed-ends down in the back of each truffle to make a fanned turkey tail. Press a candy corn, pointy-end facing toward you, on the top of each truffle to make the turkey's face and beak. Press an almond slice underneath each candy corn beak to make the turkey's waddle. Place two almond slices underneath each truffle to make the turkey's feet.                          Warm the reserved bag of chocolate mixture in the microwave until soft, 5 to 8 seconds. Squeeze the bag to pipe eyes onto the candy corn faces, and pipe decorative striped lines across the almond tails. Let set at room temperature for 30 minutes.                          Once set, the truffles can be held in a cool spot, out of the refrigerator, for up to 2 hours. Otherwise, refrigerate, covered, for up to 5 days.

When it starts bubbling, cook, stirring and watching carefully so it doesnt burn, until golden brown, 2 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a metal bowl and refrigerate until solid again, 25 to 30 minutes.Combine whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper in a food processor. Pulse once or twice to mix. Cut the butter and cream cheese into pieces; add and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add canola oil and pulse until it looks like wet sand. Add milk and pulse until small clumps form.Transfer the dough to a sheet of parchment paper and press into a ball, then press the ball into a disk about 8 inches wide. Wrap in the parchment and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 1 day before rolling out.To prepare filling: Preheat oven to 400F. Coat a large baking sheet with oil or cooking spray.Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add onions and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until just starting to lightly brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.Meanwhile, scrub squash (but dont peel it). Cut in half and remove the stem and seeds. Cut into fairly thin wedges, about 1/2 inch wide at the rind. Toss the squash with 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl, rubbing lightly with your hands until all the slices are well coated. Spread in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake, turning the slices over about halfway through, until- tender and browned, 30 to 35 minutes.When the onions are done, push them to the edges of the pan; add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the center, then add garlic and cook, stirring, about 1 minute. Add kale and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring, until the kale is wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons water, cover and cook, stirring once or twice and adding water by the tablespoon if the pan is dry, until the kale is just tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1/4 cup cheese.When the squash is done, reserve 6 of the prettiest slices. Cut the remaining slices into 1-inch pieces. Add the squash pieces to the kale mixture and combine.To roll out pastry: Dust a sheet of parchment paper, and the dough, with flour. Roll the dough out into a 15-inch circle. Go slowly and if it cracks just press the pieces together. Dust with flour as needed and keep the circle as even as you can, but dont worry about rough edges.To assemble & bake: Spread the -onion-kale-squash mixture over the pastry, leaving a 2-inch border. Arrange the reserved squash slices decoratively on top and gently press into the filling. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup cheese and pine nuts on top.Use the parchment to lift the edges of the pastry and fold loosely over the filling in 2- or 3-inch sections. It may crack as you fold it, but thats fine. Transfer the galette, parchment and all, onto a baking sheet. Trim off overhanging parchment.Bake the galette until the pastry is golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.Let cool at least 15 minutes on the baking sheet. Lift parchment and galette onto a platter; slide the parchment out. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To prepare pastry dough: Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.

Stand the squash upright on a stable surface and carefully slice through it from top to bottom to divide it in half. Repeat with the other squash.\nUse a large spoon to scoop out the spaghetti squash seeds and discard them. Drizzle the insides of each squash half with 1 teaspoon olive oil and rub it all over the inside. Sprinkle salt and pepper lightly over the interiors of the squash, then place them cut-side down on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake for 40 to 60 minutes, until the cut sides are turning golden and the interiors are easily pierced through with a fork. Small squash will be done sooner than large squash, naturally! Leave the oven on for later.\nMeanwhile, cook the spinach: In a large skillet over medium heat, warm 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the garlic and saut until fragrant, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the spinach and cook, stirring often, until its wilted.

Preheat oven to 350°F.2.   Prepare crust: Cut the butter into small pieces and place in the bowl of a food processor with the flour, thyme, salt and 1/8 tsp. of the pepper. Pulse several times to combine. Pieces of butter should still be visible. Mix the water and vinegar and slowly add to the flour mixture, pulsing to combine as you do so, until the mixture comes together. You may need to add a little more ice water. You want the crust to come together when pinched, but not to be a wet, sticky ball. Use your own judgement and add the water carefully.3.   Turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap and form it into a ball. Cover with another piece of plastic wrap and, using a rolling pin, flatten the dough into a circle about 4 inches across. Refrigerate the dough for 15 minutes while you make the filling.4.   Prepare filling: In a sauté pan, heat the oil over medium heat and sauté the onion and garlic for 2 minutes, stirring often. Add the mushrooms and continue to cook 5 minutes, or until the mushrooms are soft and there is no liquid in the pan. Set aside to cool.5.   After the dough has chilled and rested, roll it out between the two sheets of plastic to fill a 9-inch pie plate. Peel the plastic off the top and carefully transfer the crust to the plate. Peel the other layer of plastic off. Gently press the crust into the pie plate and trim the edges. If you like, give the edges a decorative fluting. (The crust may be made ahead to this point and refrigerated for 1 day or frozen for up to 1 month).6.   Whisk eggs, then add oregano, basil, nutmeg, white pepper, sea salt and black pepper.7.   Place the pie plate on a baking sheet, scatter the cheeses and sautéed mushrooms in the crust, and pour the egg mixture over the filling.8.   Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the quiche is slightly puffed, springy to the touch, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350°F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]}]},{"name":"Prepare crust","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cut the butter into small pieces and place in the bowl of a food processor with the flour, thyme, salt and 1/8 tsp. of the pepper.
