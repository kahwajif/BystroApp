Enchilada. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. You could try Bernardus Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Make enchilada sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together the chili powder, cumin, oregano, garlic powder, cinnamon, ground cloves, sugar, salt, and flour.\nHeat olive oil on medium heat in a cast iron pan (or other thick-bottomed sauté pan). Add the spices and cook for a minute or two, until fragrant.\n\nSlowly whisk in the stock, until smooth. Let come to a simmer, cook for a minute, then remove from heat, cover and set aside.\n\nPrepare the filling: Heat olive oil in a sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped onion and jalapeños and cook until the onions are translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook a minute more. Remove from heat.\nPlace onion mixture in a medium mixing bowl. Mix in the cooked turkey meat, the beans, 1 cup of the grated cheese, 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro, 2 Tbsp lime juice, and 1/2 a cup of the enchilada sauce. Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of salt, or more to taste. Set aside.\n\nAssemble the enchiladas: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Heat the pan with the enchilada sauce on medium heat. Spread 1/2 cup of the sauce over the bottom of a 9x13 casserole dish (pyrex works well).\nWorking one at a time, dip the flour tortillas in the sauce to coat them on both sides. If the sauce is too thick, thin it with a little water.\n\nPlace the tortilla in the casserole dish and place anywhere from 1/4 of a cup to 1/2 cup of the filling in the middle of the tortilla.\nRoll up the tortilla around the filling and place it in the casserole dish. Continue to roll up the rest of your tortillas until they fill the casserole dish. Cover the enchiladas with the remaining sauce, and sprinkle with the remaining cheese.\n\nBake: Place in the oven and bake, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes, until the enchiladas are heated through and the cheese has melted.\n\nSprinkle with lime juice, serve with garnishes: Sprinkle with a little more lime juice before serving. Serve with chopped red onion, chopped avocado, fresh cilantro, sour cream or crema fresca, and thinly sliced iceberg lettuce that has been dressed with vinegar and salt (no oil).","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make enchilada sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together the chili powder, cumin, oregano, garlic powder, cinnamon, ground cloves, sugar, salt, and flour.","ingredients":[{"id":1022020,"name":"garlic powder","image":"garlic-powder.png"},{"id":2011,"name":"ground clove","image":"cloves.jpg"},{"id":2009,"name":"chili powder","image":"chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":2010,"name":"cinnamon","image":"cinnamon.jpg"},{"id":2027,"name":"oregano","image":"oregano.jpg"},{"id":1002014,"name":"cumin","image":"ground-cumin.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat olive oil on medium heat in a cast iron pan (or other thick-bottomed sauté pan).","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the spices and cook for a minute or two, until fragrant.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Slowly whisk in the stock, until smooth.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"}]},{"number":5,"step":"Let come to a simmer, cook for a minute, then remove from heat, cover and set aside.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]}]},{"name":"Prepare the filling","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat olive oil in a sauté pan on medium heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the chopped onion and jalapeños and cook until the onions are translucent, about 3-4 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":4,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add the garlic and cook a minute more.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Remove from heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Place onion mixture in a medium mixing bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"mixing-bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":6,"step":"Mix in the cooked turkey meat, the beans, 1 cup of the grated cheese, 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro, 2 Tbsp lime juice, and 1/2 a cup of the enchilada sauce.","ingredients":[{"id":5167,"name":"turkey meat","image":"turkey-raw-whole.jpg"},{"id":9160,"name":"lime juice","image":"lime-juice.png"},{"id":11165,"name":"cilantro","image":"cilantro.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":7,"step":"Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of salt, or more to taste.

Combine all the brine ingredients, except the brisket, in a large non-reactive bowl. Add the brisket (you may have to cut it into 2 pieces) and rub the spice mix into the meat. Pour cold water over until the meat is covered. Weight the brisket down with a small plate so that it is completely submerged; cover and refrigerate. The meat can be brined overnight or as long as 10 days. The longer the brining the more pickled the meat.                          Heat the oven to 300 degrees F.                          Heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. Add the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, marjoram, and bay leaves and cook until starting to soften, about 10 minutes. Remove the meat from the brine and rinse it well. Set the meat on top of the vegetables and add water to just cover the meat. Bring to a boil skimming any foam that surfaces. Reduce the heat to a simmer, place the lid on the pot, and cook for 15 minutes. Add the cabbage pieces, cover, and put it into the oven; cook for 3 hours.                          Remove the meat, cover it with foil, and let it rest for 20 minutes. Cut the fat off the corned beef, slice the meat against the grain, and serve it in shallow bowls with the cabbage wedges, some cooking liquid, and the Herbed Root Vegetables.                          2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil                          2 tablespoons unsalted butter                          1 pound new potatoes, scrubbed                          1 pound baby carrots, trimmed and scrubbed                          1 pound baby turnips, trimmed and scrubbed                          1 pound baby parsnips, trimmed and scrubbed                          Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper                          1/2 pound unsalted butter, softened                          1/2 cup mixed chopped fresh herbs like thyme, mint, chives, parsley, or chervil                          Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper                          Put the olive oil and butter into a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the vegetables and toss to coat them well with the fat; season with salt and pepper. Add 1 cup water and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer, cover the pot, and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.

Melt 2 Tbsp butter in the pan, add the cubed bread, and stir to coat the bread pieces with the melted butter. Let bread cubes toast; only turn them when they have become a little browned on a side.\n\nBrown the sausage: Heat a large (4 to 6-qt) pan on medium heat. Breaking of inch-sized chunks, add the Italian sausage to the pan, taking care not to crowd the bottom of the pan.\nDo not stir, just let cook until lightly browned on one side, then flip the sausage over and brown on the other side. When lightly browned, use a slotted spoon to remove, set aside.\n\nCook the onions and apples: You should have at least a tablespoon of fat in the pan, if not, add some butter.

Add the onions and celery and cook until onions are translucent, 3-5 minutes.\nAdd the chopped apples and cook for a few minutes more.\n\nCombine the stuffing: Add back in the browned sausage, the butter toasted bread cubes, parsley, thyme, and sage. Gently mix. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat.\n\nPrepare roasting pan and stuff the roast: Preheat oven to 350°F. Place the crown roast in a shallow roasting pan. Fill the center of the crown loosely with stuffing (do not pack in the stuffing).\nWhatever extra stuffing you have, place in a separate, buttered, oven proof pan.\nCover the tips of the ribs with aluminum foil to prevent scorching of the bones.\nAdd one cup water to the pan.\n\nRoast the pork: Roast the pork at 350°F on middle rack of oven. Cover the stuffing with foil after about 30 minutes.\nCook until a meat thermometer inserted deep into center of meat (do not touch bones, which are on the outside of the roast) registers 145°F, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours total.\n\nBake extra stuffing: Add 1/2 cup of water to the remaining stuffing, and bake it (next to or under roast, starting 30 minutes before roast is done, or while the roast is resting), covered with foil, 30 minutes.\n\nLet the pork rest: Transfer pork to a platter and let stand 20 minutes.\n\nCarve: To carve the pork, steady the roast with a fork, with a large sharp knife, cut down through each rib to detach the pork chops.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Season the pork roast: ","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix together the roast seasonings of thyme, sage, salt and pepper.

vegetarian"],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"Cake recipe method: Position one rack in the center and a second rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350°F/180°C/gas 4. Butter three 9-in/23-cm cake pans with 1½-in/4-cm sides. Line the bottom of each pan with a circle of parchment paper. Butter the parchment paper. Sprinkle one pan with a spoonful of flour, and then tilt and tap the pan to distribute the flour evenly. Turn the pan upside down over the sink and gently shake out the excess flour. Repeat with the second and third pans.In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg. In another bowl, stir together the parsnips, coconut, walnuts, and raisins.In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl using a handheld mixer, beat together the sugar and oil until smooth, about 2 minutes. Begin the mixer on low speed and then increase to medium speed so the oil doesn’t splatter. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition until the batter is smooth. On low speed, add the flour mixture and beat just until it disappears. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the parsnip mixture until evenly distributed.Divide the batter among the prepared pans, spreading it evenly in each pan. Bake the cakes until they just start pulling away from the sides of the pan and a toothpick inserted into the center of a cake comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. For even baking, at the midpoint, switch the pans between the racks and rotate them front to back. Let the cakes cool in the pans on wire racks for 15 minutes. Run a table knife around the inside edge of each pan to loosen the cake sides. Invert the cakes onto the racks and peel off the parchment paper. Let cool completely before frosting.Frosting recipe method: In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl using the handheld mixer, beat the cream cheese on medium speed until smooth, about 3 minutes. Add the butter and beat until combined, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioners’ sugar and lemon juice and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes.Place one cake layer, top-side down, on a cake plate. Using an offset spatula, spread one-third of the frosting over the top. Spread the frosting right to the edge of the top without frosting the sides. Carefully set the second cake layer on top, placing it top-side down and lining up the edges. Spread half of the remaining frosting on top of the layer the same way. Place the third cake layer on top, right-side up. Spread the remaining frosting over the top of the cake, again without frosting the sides. Swirl the frosting to decorate the top and then garnish the top evenly with the coconut, if desired. Refrigerate the cake for at least 45 minutes to set the frosting. Remove from the refrigerator 30 to 40 minutes before serving.Cook’s note: If you have a shredding blade for your food processor, you can make quick work of grating the parsnips. Otherwise, use the coarse holes on a box grater.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cake recipe method: Position one rack in the center and a second rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350°F/180°C/gas","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Butter three 9-in/23-cm cake pans with 1½-in/4-cm sides.

Stir until smooth. Set aside to cool.In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon; sift or whisk together to mix. Set aside.In a small bowl, stir the milk and vanilla extract together. Set aside.In a large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Tip: To cream, start by placing the butter in the bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed begin by beating the butter about 1 minute until it is smooth and light in color. With the mixer still on medium speed, slowly add the sugar to the butter, either one tablespoon at a time, or in a very slow steady stream, taking from 4 to 8 minutes to add all of the sugar, and beating until the butter and sugar are fully incorporated and the mixture is a light, or pale yellow color, with a fluffy texture. While adding the sugar, stop the mixer occasionally to scrape the mixture off the paddle and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly.Add eggs one at a time, beating until thoroughly mixed. Tip: For each egg, crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk with a fork to thoroughly break up the egg before adding to the creamed mixture. Start with the mixer on low speed so the liquid from the egg doesnt splatter, once the egg is partially mixed increase the speed to medium. Each egg should be fully incorporated into the mixture before adding the next egg, taking about one minute to blend in each egg.With the mixer on low speed, add the chocolate mixture, mix about 1 minute until well blended.With the mixer on low speed, add about one third of the flour mixture, mix just until the flour is almost completely blended. Scrape the bowl down, and add about one half of the milk mixture, blending just until mixed. Scrape the bowl down again and continue alternating with the flour mixture and milk mixture, ending with the last portion of the flour, and stirring just until blended.Spoon the batter into the cupcake liners. Fill about  full, using about  cup of batter per cup. Tip: Avoid over-filling the liners which may cause the batter to run-over the sides when baking. It is better to bake any remaining batter separately after the first pan of cupcakes has finished baking.Bake: Bake, rotating pan halfway through, 18 to 20 minutes, or until the cakes are just firm and spring back when gently pressed, and a toothpick, wooden skewer, or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool slightly in cupcake pan, and turn out of pan when cool enough to handle. Repeat process with any remaining batter. Cool cupcakes completely on a wire cooling rack before frosting.Dip cooled cupcakes into prepared poured fondant. The easiest way to cover cupcakes is to dip them in the fondant. Hold the cupcake upside down and dip the top of the cupcake into the bowl of fondant up to the paper liner. Lift the cupcake up and continue to hold upside down for 3 to 5 seconds to allow some of the excess fondant to drip off, swipe a spatula about one inch under the cake to cut the drip off, then turn the cupcake upright and allow the drip to settle on top of the cake. Let the cupcakes sit until the fondant is firm to the touch, the fondant icing sets quickly.Use the small artist paint brush to lightly moisten the red sugar heart sprinkles with clear alcohol. Sprinkle with red edible glitter. Set aside to dry until ready to use.In a medium bowl, and using an electric hand mixer or wooden spoon, combine powdered sugar, corn syrup, vanilla. Add warm milk in small quantities, start with 1 tablespoon of milk, then when its getting close to the right consistency add milk in teaspoonfuls or just drops of milk at a time, until it is the desired consistency; for piping, the icing should be like a thick sour cream. Tint with black food coloring.When the glaze is the right consistency, spoon into a pastry bag fitted with a small piping decorating tip. Or, spoon into a small plastic freezer bag. Put a little piece of tape on corner to reinforce the tip, and then roll over top of bag to keep neater. Twist the top of the bag to create some pressure to make easier to squeeze out. Cut a tiny corner off the tip of the bag. Or, use a plastic squeeze bottle with a tip available in decorating stores.When the poured fondant icing is set, pipe the black glaze in a zigzag pattern across the top of each cupcake. While the glaze is still wet, place 5 or 6 sugar hearts randomly on top of the glaze. Tip: the hearts are tiny, pick them up with tweezers and place on the glaze to avoid marring the zigzag pattern.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium mixing bowl, combine the cocoa powder and hot water.

Lift the cupcake up and continue to hold upside down for 3 to 5 seconds to allow some of the excess fondant to drip off, swipe a spatula about one inch under the cake to cut the drip off, then turn the cupcake upright and allow the drip to settle on top of the cake.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":405900,"name":"wire rack","image":"wire-rack.jpg"},{"id":404671,"name":"muffin tray","image":"muffin-tray.jpg"},{"id":404644,"name":"toothpicks","image":"toothpicks.jpg"},{"id":404642,"name":"spatula","image":"spatula-or-turner.jpg"},{"id":3065,"name":"skewers","image":"wooden-skewers.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}],"length":{"number":18,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Let the cupcakes sit until the fondant is firm to the touch, the fondant icing sets quickly.Use the small artist paint brush to lightly moisten the red sugar heart sprinkles with clear alcohol.
