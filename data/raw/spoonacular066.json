The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

Heat the bacon fat (or butter or vegetable oil) in a large saut√© pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saut√©, stirring only occasionally, until the edges of the onions begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle salt over the onions as they cook. Add the sliced cabbage and toss to combine. Cook for a minute or two, then add the celery seed, caraway, and stock. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook, covered for 10 minutes.2 After 10 minutes, remove from heat, but leave the cover on the pan. Wait another 5 minutes, then uncover the pan and mix in the mustard and vinegar. Add salt and black pepper to taste.3 As soon as you cover the cabbage pan in step 1, heat a tablespoon of bacon fat or oil in a cast iron frying pan on medium high heat. Pat the pork chops dry with paper towels. Sprinkle them with salt and lay them in the pan, working in batches if necessary as to not crowd the pan.Tip: Place the chops in the pan so that the thickest, boniest parts are near the center of the pan where they get the most heat.As soon as the chops are nicely browned on one side, about 2 minutes or so, flip them and sear them on the other side. If your pork chops are less than 3/4-inch thick, and you are using a cast iron pan, once the chops are seared on the second side, remove the pan from heat and let the chops sit in the hot pan until cooked through (you can use the finger test to check for the doneness of the meat).

Place the flour in a medium mixing bowl. Form a well in the center and spoon in the yogurt, holding the whey if there is any. Add the diced butter and salt, and use a pastry blender (or a sturdy fork, or the tips of your fingers) to combine the ingredients, blending the butter into the flour. Alternatively, you can mix the dough in a food processor, using short pulses.When most of the flour is absorbed and you can no longer see pieces of butter in the dough (depending on the specific flour, yogurt and butter you'll use, your dough will be moister or drier than mine; feel free to add a little flour or a few drops of water to get a workable consistency), turn the mixture out onto a clean work surface and gather the dough into a  ball, kneading it very briefly so it comes together, then flattening it into a thick disk. Place the dough on a plate and let it rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.(If you wish to make it in advance, cover with plastic wrap, and keep in the fridge for up to a day. Let it come back to just below room temperature before rolling out.)Preheat the oven to 180¬∞C (360¬∞F).Roll the dough out thinly between two sheets of parchment paper to form whatever shape seems easiest -- I like it free-form.Remove the top sheet of paper, sprinkle the dough with sesame seeds, place the top sheet back and roll over it with the rolling pin so the sesame seeds will embed themselves in the pastry; this provides flavor and crunch.Remove the top sheet of paper and roll the very edges of the dough over themselves to form a small ridge all around. Crimp if desired.Transfer the pastry (and bottom sheet of paper) to a baking sheet. Prick all over with a fork, cover with the top sheet of paper, and top with baking beans. Place in the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown.Remove the top sheet and the baking beans (they will be very hot, obviously) and let the crust cool completely.Beat the fresh cheese with a dash of milk to get a creamy consistency. Snip the mint leaves finely and add them to the fresh cheese. Spread all over the crust.Trim the zucchini and cut into paper-thin slices with a mandolin (I am very happy with my Japanese mandolin). Spread the zucchini slices out evenly over the fresh cheese without worrying about the pattern. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, drizzle with good olive oil, and sprinkle with thyme.Cut into servings, preferably with a bread knife.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Start by making the dough.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the flour in a medium mixing bowl.

the CrustPrepare an 8-inch springform pan with cooking spray and then wipe the sides gently with a paper towel. Pulse the whole cookies, including the frosting, in a food processor until fine. Microwave the butter in small microwave safe bowl in 30 second bursts until melted. Pour the cookie crumbs into a medium size bowl and drizzle with the melted butter. Stir until there are no crumbs left. Pour the crumbs into the springform pan and press firmly into the bottom and up the sides to create a thick crust.For the FillingPlace the mixing bowl and whisk attachment in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes to chill.Meanwhile, in a microwave-safe bowl, combine the white chocolate and 5 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream and microwave at 50 percent power for 60 to 90 seconds until the chocolate starts to melt. Whisk vigorously until the chocolate is completely smooth, then set aside for 10 to 15 minutes.Prepare the whipped cream by pouring the remaining 1 cups of whipping cream int the chilled mixing bowl. Beat the cream with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the cream gets bubbly. Slowly add the powdered sugar and continue beating on high speed until stiff peaks form. Set aside.Beat the cream cheese on medium-high speed for 2 to 3 minutes until its light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally. Slowly pour in the melted white chocolate and beat on low speed until the chocolate and cream cheese are well combined.Microwave the dulce de leche for about 20 to 30 seconds until it can be easily stirred. Pour the dulce de leche into the cream cheese mixture and beat until all of the ingredients are well mixed to form your mousse. Fold the prepared whipped cream into the mousse until combined. Pour the filling into the prepared piecrust and spread until the top is smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours or until the filling is firm.For the ToppingPrepare 1 cup of the whipped cream as described above, using just the whipped cream. Remove the springform pan edge. Microwave the dulce de leche and the 2 tablespoons of whipped cream in a microwave safe bowl for 30 seconds. Stir well to combine and allow to cool until just warm. Working quickly, spread in a circular motion in the center of the pie. Use a large star tip to pipe a whip cream border on the outside edges of the pie.

Melt chocolate on stove. To do so, place chocolate in a large heat-proof mixing bowl. Find a pot that will be a tight fit for the bowl (the bowl can be put inside but will be several inches away from touching the bottom of your pot. Add about 1/2-1 inch of water into your pot and bring to a simmer. Place your chocolate bowl on top, making sure the bowl never touches the water. Stir chocolate with a clean spatula until it is completely melted and smooth. Turn off stove but keep chocolate bowl over the water pot so the chocolate does not cool down.2. Add about 1/2 tsp of melted chocolate to the bottom of each mold (between 20-24 of them). Bangthe bottom of your silicone panagainst the counter a few times so that the chocolate spreads evenly across the bottom of each mold. Using the back of a small spoon, dip it into your bowl of melted chocolate and then use the back of the spoon to coat the inner sides of each mold, making sure to not leave any crevice uncovered. Place into fridge to harden for about 20 minutes.3. While you are waiting for chocolate shells to harden, you can make your filling. Add Oreos and cream cheese to food processor and mix until cookies have become small crumbs, and thick paste forms.4. Remove chocolate shells from fridge once they have hardened. Add about 1 tsp of cookies and cream mixture to each candy mold, making sure you leave a little room at the top to add more chocolate to seal the shells.5. If your remainingmelted chocolate still sitting in the bowl has gotten a little hard, you can stir it around and it should go back to its original melted state. If it doesn't, you can also reheat for a few minutes on stove using the same method in step 1.6. Spoon a little more chocolate into each shell to cover surface. Bang bottom of silicone pan against counter a few times to smooth out the surface of the candy cups. Place in fridge for about 20 minutes until tops have hardened. Chocolates should easily pop out of molds. Store any uneaten ones in fridge for about 3 days or in freezer for a few weeks. Since you are using cream cheese, don't leave these sitting out.

What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

                         Set oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 400¬∞F. Add flour, 1/3 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse several times to mix. Add butter pieces and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal, 6 to 8 one-second pulses. Transfer mixture to a large bowl.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            In a small bowl whisk together eggs and milk. Add liquid to flour mixture. Stir with a spoon until well incorporated and a sticky dough begins to form. Turn dough out on a very well floured surface, sprinkle the top with flour, and knead lightly until you have a soft, workable dough. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15 minutes.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Butter a 9- by 13-inch glass or metal baking dish and set aside. Cut off 2/3 of the dough and return remaining dough to refrigerator. Sprinkle top of dough lightly with flour then cover with a large sheet of plastic wrap and roll out into a rectangle that overlaps the edges of the baking dish by about 2 inches. Lay rolled out dough into the dish, press into the bottom and along the sides.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Add sliced peaches to a large bowl. Dissolve cornstarch in 2 tablespoons of water in a small bowl. Pour mixture over peaches and toss to coat. Transfer peaches to dough-lined pan. In a small bowl mix together light brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg then sprinkle mixture over peaches. Dot with butter pieces.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Divide remaining dough in half, turn it out on a very well floured surface, sprinkle top lightly with flour then cover with a large sheet of plastic wrap and roll out to a large sheet approximately 13 inches long and approximately 1/4 inch thick. Cut the dough into 4 long strips and arrange evenly across the length of the dish (do not press into the sides yet).  Repeat rolling out process with remaining dough, this time rolling out a wider sheet that's approximately 9 inches long. Cut the dough into 5 strips. Weave the lattice crust together (for a visual guide, check out this Sweet Technique slideshow). Sprinkle crust with remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar.                                                                                                                            6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Bake until crust is golden brown and peaches are bubbly, 45 to 50 minutes.

Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes.

Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8073684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Ffonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998%2F12434"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Slice the top off squash, then cut in half lengthwise and remove seeds with a spoon. Place squash halves cut side up on a baking sheet then brush with extra virgin olive oil and season liberally with salt and pepper.Roast for 50-60 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the thickest part of the squash meets no resistance.When squash is cool enough to handle, scoop the flesh from the peel and place in a food processor. Process until very smooth (or whip with a mixer).Place squash in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook (or just mix in a large bowl by hand) add in whisked egg and salt. Add flour, 1 cup at a time, and knead until the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl. Add 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese and knead until combined. Turn out onto a heavily floured surface and knead until dough comes together. Dough will be sticky*, just keep flouring hands lightly. I also like to sprinkle in some parmesane cheese in place of some of the flour*. Remove large hunks of the dough then roll into a rope and cut into 1 inch sections to form the gnocchi. Place onto a wax paper, cover until ready to boil.For the Sauce: Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat, then add garlic and sage. Cook until garlic is just starting to turn golden brown, be carful you do not want to burn your garlic.To cook gnocchi: Bring a large pot of water to a boil then salt lightly. Add 1 cup gnocchi at a time to the salted, boiling water, then cook at a gentle boil until gnocchi float to the top, about 2 minutes. Transfer using a slotted spoon or spider to your sauce. Cook remaining gnocchi then add to the sauce. Season with salt & pepper then toss to coat.Serve with a dusting  parmesan cheese is desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
