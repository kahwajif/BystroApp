Unfold the thighs and, using a sharp knife, slice each thigh into strips about 2 inches long and 1/2 inch thick. You should have about 72 strips, although the size and number of strips will depend on the size of thighs. (We’ve noticed that thighs on chickens tend to vary almost as widely as those on people, so if you end up with more or fewer strips, don’t worry.) Thread 3 or 4 chicken pieces onto each soaked skewer, without crowding them, then lightly season the chicken with salt and lightly brush them with the oil.3. Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for direct grilling over high heat. Brush and oil the grill grate.4. Grill the chicken yakitori skewers directly over high heat, turning once, until well marked and cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Arrange the skewers on a platter.

Set up a steamer over boiling water. Steam the potatoes until tender, about 25 minutes. While the potatoes are still hot, mash them with a potato masher or press them through a potato ricer and return them to the empty pot, turn them into a large bowl, or plop them on a clean work surface.2. Dump 1 cup flour, egg, and a pinch salt into the potato mixture. Knead the mixture until a soft, smooth, elastic dough forms, adding just enough of the remaining 3/4 cup flour to keep the dough from sticking. (Be careful with the ratio of potato to flour: If there is too much flour, the gnocchi will be hard; if there is too much potato, the gnocchi will tend to fall apart while cooking.) Taste a little dough to make sure there’s enough salt. If not, work in a little more salt with your hands.3. Shape the dough into about 6 long ropes, each just over 2/3 inch in diameter. Cut each roll into 1/2- to 3/4-inch lengths. Using the floured thumb of 1 hand, press each length to make a dimple in the center, then, if desired, gently roll it against the face of a fine grater to imprint the pattern on the underside. (Alternatively, hold a fork at a 45° angle with the curved side facing you and the tips of the tines touching your work surface. Working with 1 length at a time, roll it down the back side of the tines, pressing gently with your thumb, to make ridges on 1 side. The gnocchi may curl slightly but that’s okay.) Place the gnocchi in a single layer on a clean dish towel dusted with flour or a baking sheet lined with wax or parchment paper. (You can freeze the gnocchi in individual-serving-size plastic bags. Do not thaw the gnocchi before cooking.)4. To cook the gnocchi, bring a large pot of slightly salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi to the water, a few at a time, and cook until they float to the surface. Do not overcook the gnocchi or they’ll fall apart. Use a slotted spoon to remove the gnocchi as soon as they rise to the surface, allowing any excess water to fall back into the pot. Transfer the gnocchi to a warm serving dish or platter and add the butter or sauce. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Set up a steamer over boiling water. Steam the potatoes until tender, about 25 minutes.
