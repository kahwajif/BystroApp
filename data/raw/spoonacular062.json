vegetarian"],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"Dough - To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine 4 cups flour, 1/3 cup sugar, yeast, salt to taste; set aside. Place 6 tablespoons butter in a small microwave-safe bowl, and heat to melt, about 45 seconds; set aside. Crack eggs in another bowl and whisk; set aside. Add buttermilk to a glass measuring cup and warm to temperature, about 45 seconds on high power in the microwave. (Based on the type of yeast used, milk temperatures will vary. Red Star Platinum yeast calls for warmer temperatures than most, 120 to 130F; other brands and yeast call for much lower temperatures, about 95 to 105F. Warm milk according to manufacturer's recommendations on the packaging. Taking the temperature with a digital thermometer is highly recommended, but if you're not, make sure the milk is warm, not hot. Err on the cooler rather than hotter side so you don't kill the yeast.) If the milk separates or gets a little funny looking after being warmed, whisk it to smooth it out. To the dry ingredients in the stand mixer, add the melted butter, eggs, buttermilk, and beat on medium-low speed for about 1 minute, or until combined. Switch to the dough hook (the dough will have stuck to the paddle and just pick off what you can and put it into the bowl) and knead for 10 to 12 minutes (15 to 18 minutes by hand). If after 5 minutes more flour is needed, add the remaining 1/4 cup flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough clears the side of the bowl but sticks to the bottom. This is a very sticky, tacky, moist, and borderline sloppy dough; don't be tempted to over-flour it. It's supposed to be that way. The more flour you add now, the less fluffy and more dense the rolls will be. Dough should clear the sides of the mixer while kneading but sticking to the bottom is fine. Remove the dough from the mixing bowl, spray a large mixing with cooking spray, and place the dough in the bowl. Cover with plasticwrap and place it in a warm, draft-free place to rise for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or doubled in size. I keep my bowl inside a powered-off oven. Every 45 minutes or so, I power on the oven for 1 minute to 400F, as if I am preheating it, then I power it off. Do not, repeat not, keep the oven on. These short bursts of 1 minute of heat create a stable 85F-ish warm environment, ideal for the yeast. If your rising spot is cold, it will take longer than 2 1/2 hours. Prepare a 11-by-17-inch or similar sized jellyroll pan or sheetcake pan with a raised edge, or use a 9-by-13-inch pan. I prefer a jellyroll pan because it's slightly larger so the rolls are less squished, have more room to rise, and bake more evenly. Line pan with aluminum foil, spray with cooking spray; set aside. Rolling Out the Dough - After dough has doubled in size, punch it down. Turn dough out onto a floured Silpat or floured countertop. Knead it lightly for about 2 minutes. With a rolling pin, roll it out to a 16-by-12-inch rectangle; just slightly larger than a standard Silpat. Filling - With a knife, butter the dough with 1/2 cup soft butter, leaving a 3/4-inch border around the edges. Sprinkle the brown sugar over it. Sprinkle the cinnamon over the brown sugar; I was very generous with the cinnamon and used almost 5 teaspoons and recommend at least 3; just eyeball it and shake it on. Slicing the Dough - Loosen the dough from the counter using a bench scraper (or metal spatula), and starting with a long edge, roll the dough into a tight log. Pinch the seam closed and turn log so seam side is down. Gently stretch the log to be 18 inches in length with an even diameter all the way around and pat the ends to even them up. Don't fret if your log isn't perfect; it's okay. Slice the cylinder into 12 evenly sized rolls (about 1 1/2 inches wide) using a bench scraper, serrated knife, or plain unwaxed dental floss (works great to not squish and compact the log). Arrange the rolls cut side down in the prepared baking pan. Cover with plastic wrap. Decide to Make Straight Through - Let rise in a warm, draft-free place until the rolls have nearly doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Or...Decide to Make as Overnight Rolls - Don't let rolls rise after they've been sliced and placed in covered pan. Place pan in refrigerator for up to 16 hours. Before baking, let the rolls sit at room temperature until they have nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour. Baking -For either version, bake at 350F for 22 to 25 minutes, or until lightly golden on top and cooked through but not overly browned. Immediately and generously, spread cream cheese frosting on the warm rolls. Serve immediately. Rolls are best eaten fresh, but will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. Reheat leftover rolls for a few seconds in the microwave before serving. If you have issues with cream cheese frosting at room temperature, then refrigerate the leftover rolls; I don't. Cream Cheese Frosting - I recommend making this at night if you're doing the overnight version, refrigerating it, and taking out along with the rolls as they rise so when you need it, it's well softened. Frosting may be halved (makes about 3 cups as written), but unused frosting can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks and I have frozen frosting for up to 3 months; I'd rather have too much than not enough. All measurements and ingredients are to taste; consider adding buttermilk, almond extract, orange zest, heavy cream, or your other favorite specialty tweaks as desired. I keep it very simple. To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine 1/2 cup butter, cream cheese, and beat on medium speed to combine, about 1 minute. Add the vanilla, 3 cups confectioners' sugar (I don't bother sifting), and beat until smooth and fluffy, about 3 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Add remaining 1 cup of sugar (or more, or none) as necessary, to taste, based on desired frosting consistency and flavor.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Dough - To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine 4 cups flour, 1/3 cup sugar, yeast, salt to taste; set aside.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"yeast-granules.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404665,"name":"stand mixer","image":"stand-mixer.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place 6 tablespoons butter in a small microwave-safe bowl, and heat to melt, about 45 seconds; set aside.

Reheat leftover rolls for a few seconds in the microwave before serving. If you have issues with cream cheese frosting at room temperature, then refrigerate the leftover rolls; I don't. Cream Cheese Frosting - I recommend making this at night if you're doing the overnight version, refrigerating it, and taking out along with the rolls as they rise so when you need it, it's well softened. Frosting may be halved (makes about 3 cups as written), but unused frosting can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks and I have frozen frosting for up to 3 months; I'd rather have too much than not enough. All measurements and ingredients are to taste; consider adding buttermilk, almond extract, orange zest, heavy cream, or your other favorite specialty tweaks as desired. I keep it very simple.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, salt and ginger.

Cool in the pan for 3 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely (cooling the cupcakes in the pan completely will make them tough).                          For the frosting: In the heatproof bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the sugar, salt and egg whites. Place the bowl over a saucepan of gently simmering water to create a double boiler (make sure there is space between the water and the bottom of the bowl). Whisking by hand, heat the mixture until slightly thickened, a bit lighter in color and hot to the touch; a candy thermometer dipped into the mixture should reach 160 degrees F (very important so that the frosting will whip up firmly!). Return the bowl to the stand mixer. Whip the mixture on high speed until very thick, fluffy and pale latte in color, 5 to 10 minutes depending on your mixer. The frosting is done when it's very stiff and the bowl is completely cool to the touch all over.                          Top the cooled cupcakes with 2 tablespoons frosting per cake. Dust lightly with ground cinnamon to garnish.

Process in your ice cream maker according to the machine’s instructions.Meanwhile, wipe out the saucepan you used to make the custard base, and fill it with water. Heat over high heat until it comes to a rapid simmer, then reduce to low and place a heatproof bowl on top to make a bain-marie. (OR you can use a double boiler).Combine cream and corn syrup in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook until bubbling. Remove from heat and whisk in chocolate and ½ tsp peppermint extract and taste. Add a few more drops of extract if desired. Cool the fudge swirl to room temperature.Line a loaf pan with parchment paper. Using a big spoon, drop alternating dollops of ice cream and fudge into the pan, sprinkling crushed candy canes between the layers. Use a wooden or metal skewer (or a paring knife) to gently swirl the ice cream and fudge together a bit. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.

Sauvignon Blanc are great choices for Salmon. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. You could try Chehalem INOX Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442371,"title":"Chehalem INOX Chardonnay","description":"INOX® takes its name from the abbreviation of the French word for stainless steel, inoxydable. The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

Set aside.In a small bowl, combine buttermilk, pumpkin, and vanilla; stir together. Set aside.In a large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Tip: To cream, start by placing the butter in the bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed begin by beating the butter about 1 minute until it is smooth and light in color. With the mixer still on medium speed, slowly add the granulated sugar to the butter, either one tablespoon at a time, or in a very slow steady stream, taking from 4 to 5 minutes to add all of the sugar, then add the brown sugar, taking an additional 3 to 4 minutes, beating until the butter and sugar are fully incorporated and the mixture is a light, or pale yellow color, with a fluffy texture. While adding the sugars, stop the mixer occasionally to scrape the mixture off the paddle and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly.Add eggs and egg yolk one at a time, beating until thoroughly mixed. Tip: For each egg, crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk with a fork to thoroughly break up the egg before adding to the creamed mixture. Start with the mixer on low speed so the liquid from the egg doesnt splatter, once the egg is partially mixed increase the speed to medium. Each egg should be fully incorporated into the mixture before adding the next egg, taking about one minute to blend in each egg.With the mixer on low speed, add about one third of the flour mixture, mix just until the flour is almost completely blended. Scrape the bowl down, and add about one half of the buttermilk mixture, blending just until mixed. Scrape the bowl down again and continue alternating with the flour mixture and buttermilk mixture, ending with the last portion of the flour, and stirring just until blended.Bake: Spoon the batter into the prepared pans and smooth the surface with the back of a large spoon. Bake 35 minutes or until a long toothpick, wooden skewer, or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and place pans on a wire cooling rack to cool for 10 to 15 minutes then remove cake from the pans and place the cake on the wire cooling rack to finish cooling.In a medium size bowl, add cream cheese, beat with an electric hand mixer or wooden spoon until smooth and fluffy. Add 1 cups powdered sugar, cocoa, cinnamon, and vanilla; beat until well mixed.In another medium bowl, using an electric mixer with clean beaters, beat the whipping cream until soft mounds form; add  cup powdered sugar and orange food coloring, continue beating until thick and stiff.Using a balloon type whisk or large rubber spatula, gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture.Place one cooled cake layer on a cake plate. Use an offset spatula to spread about 1 cups frosting over the top. Top with the remaining cake layer and use the remaining frosting for the top and sides of cake. Spread the frosting as smooth as possible over the top and sides.Refrigerate the cake at least one hour to stabilize the whipped cream before glazing.Place the chopped chocolate and butter in a medium bowl. Set aside.In a small heavy saucepan over medium low heat, heat the cream until it is hot and just beginning to steam. Remove from heat and pour over the chocolate, stirring until the chocolate and butter is completely melted. Add corn syrup, stirring until completely mixed.Pour the chocolate mixture into a pitcher, or liquid measuring cup with a pouring spout and let chocolate glaze cool for 10 minutes. Do not let the glaze sit longer than 10 minutes because it will thicken and become difficult to pour over the cake.Slowly pour the glaze over the cake. Cover the top of the cake entirely, letting some of the glaze drizzle down the sides, and allowing some of the frosting to show through the drizzles around the side of the cake. Tip: If the glaze doesnt flow easily it means it has cooled and thickened too much. Either slightly reheat the glaze in a saucepan over low heat, or add an extra one or two tablespoons of corn Syrup.Refrigerate the cake until the glaze is set and the frosting is firm, at least one hour.To serve, slice the cake with a long serrated knife, cleaning the knife between each slice. Refrigerate leftovers.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium mixing bowl, combine flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; sift or whisk together to mix.

This is easy to do if you place the potato between the two chopsticks to stop your knife at the perfect depth.

(see photos in post)\nPlace cut potatoes in a large bowl. If there's any moisture on the potatoes, blot them with a dish towel. The drier the better for browning. Toss the potatoes with olive oil, salt and pepper.\nRoast Potatoes: Spread potatoes out on a rimmed baking sheet cut-side down. Roast in the bottom of the oven. Total roasting time will be about 45 minutes, flipping the baking sheet around after 20 minutes, to ensure even cooking. Check potatoes for doneness after 35 minutes by lifting one or two off the baking sheet with a spatula.

Marinate for 6 hours or overnight.Preheat oven to 325 degrees.Remove pork from the marinade and pat dry. Reserve  cup of the marinade and discard the rest.Heat a large oven proof skillet to high and add olive oil. Let oil heat to hot and place pork into hot oil.Cook the pork for approximately 3 minutes on each side. Try not to move it as it sears on each side. Once you flip it to the last side, place a probe thermometer into the thickest end and place the pan in the oven. When you attached the other end of your thermometer to the device, set the temperature to alarm at 143 degrees. Depending on the size and thickness of the tenderloin, this could take between 15 and 25 minutes.Once the temperature reaches 143 degrees, remove from the oven and place pork on a plate to rest 5-10 minutes before slicing (leave the probe in while the meat rests).Note: The pork will continue to cook after its taken out of the oven so ideally, you want to remove it from the oven before it is fully cooked so that it doesnt become overdone as the pork rests before cutting. You always want cooked meats to \"rest\" for 5-10 minutes after cooking so that the juices have a chance to redistribute throughout the meat. If you cut the meat right away, all of the juices will flow out and the meat will be dry and tough when you eat it.While the meat is resting, place a pot holder over the pan handle to remind yourself that the pan just came out of the oven and is hot.

Scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan.Once most of the vermouth has evaporated, add pomegranate juice, diced apple, Agave nectar and the  cup of reserved marinade.Cook until liquid is reduced by half and add in the butter.

Swirl in the remaining tablespoons butter, and when it foams, add the shallots and remaining 1 teaspoon thyme. Saute about 2 minutes, until the shallots are translucent. Add the remaining 1/2 cup vermouth and reduce by half. Transfer to a bowl and let cool a few minutes. Whisk in the mustard, egg, chopped tarragon, and a pinch of black pepper.Remove the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking, to bring it to room temperature.

After 15 minutes, season the thighs well on both sides with salt and pepper.Return the same saute pan to high heat for about 2 minutes. Swirl in the olive oil, and wait 1 minute. Place the chicken thighs in the pan, skin side down, and cook 8 to 10 minutes, until the skin is a deep golden brown. Turn the thighs over and cook a minute or two on the other side. Place the chicken on the braised leeks. Turn off the heat and discard the fat. Add the chicken stock to the pan, and scrape with a wooden spoon to release the crispy bits stuck to the bottom. Pour the chicken stock over the braised leeks.Toss the chicken thighs in the bowl with the mustard mixture, slathering them completely, and then rearrange them over the braised leeks. Spoon any remaining mustard mixture over the chicken thighs. Top each thigh with breadcrumbs, patting with your hands to make sure they get nicely coated. (You want lots of mustard mixture and lots of breadcrumbs.) Bake about 40 minutes, until the chicken is just cooked through. To check for doneness, piece the meat near the bone with a paring knife; when ready, the juices from the chicken will run clear.Turn the oven up to 475F and cook the chicken thighs another 10 minutes, until the breadcrumbs are golden brown.Serve in the baking dish, or transfer to a large warm platter.Braised LeeksAdapted from Sunday Suppers at LucquesYou can pair these with the chicken dish above but seriously, if this recipe seems too daunting altogether, at least promise youll make these alone. With a hard or soft-cooked egg, a mustard vinaigrette, a sharp salad and crusty bread, youll have the best meal ever. And this dish reheats great  we actually made this part a day or two in advance.6 large leeksAbout 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil (though I always skimp and use less)1 cup sliced shallots1 tablespoon thyme leaves1/2 cup dry white wine1 1/2 to 2 cups chicken or vegetable stock or waterkosher salt and freshly ground black pepperPreheat the oven to 400F.Remove any bruised outer layers from the leeks. Trim off to the roots, leaving the root end intact. Trim the tops of the leeks on the diagonal, leaving 2 inches of the green part attached. Cut the leeks in half lengthwise, and submerge in a large bowl of cold water to clean them. Shake the leeks well to dislodge the dirt stuck inside. Let them sit a few minutes, to allow any grit inside the layers to fall to the bottom of the bowl. Repeat the process until the water is clean. Place the leeks, cut side down, on a towel and pat dry completely.Turn the leeks over so their cut sides are facing up, and season with 2 teaspoons salt and a few grindings of black pepper.Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Pour in 1/4 cup olive oil, and wait 1 minute. Place the leeks in the pan, cut side down, being careful not to crowd them. (you will probably need to saute them in batches or in two pans. Add more olive oil to the pan as needed, for each batch.) Sear them 4 to 5 minutes, until they are golden brown. Season the backs of the leeks with salt and pepper, and turn them over to cook another 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer them to a large gratin dish, lining them up, cut sides facing up. (Choose a baking dish or gratin dish that can go from oven to table and that will accommodate all the leeks and chick thighs, or use two smaller dishes.)Pour 1/4 cup olive oil into the pan and heat over medium heat. Add the shallots, thyme, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of pepper. Cook about 5 minutes, until the shallots are just beginning to color. Add the white wine and reduce by half. Add 1 1/2 cups stock, and bring to a boil over high heat.Pour the liquid over the leeks. The stock should not quite cover them; add more stock if necessary.Braise in the oven 30 minutes, until the leeks are tender when pierced. (This always takes longer in my oven, but is less to be concerned about if youre going to top them with the chicken, in which case theyll have plenty of additional baking time.)See more: Chicken, Leeks, Photo, SpringDo more: Link | Bookmark| Pin | Print| Email| 119 Comments","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Return the saute pan to medium heat for 1 minute.

Cross the turkey's legs and tie tightly to seal. Stuff the cavity on the large side of the breasts underneath the flap of skin with more stuffing. Transfer any remaining stuffing to an appropriately sized baking dish (you should have a couple quarts left). Refrigerate extra dish of stuffing until ready to roast after turkey is cooked.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Remove roasting pan from oven, transfer V-rack to roasting pan, and immediately place back on floor of oven with legs of turkey facing rear. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F. Roast until golden brown and deepest part of breast registers 145°F on an instant read thermometer, stuffing registers at least 135°F, and legs register at least 165°F, 3 to 4 hours total, basting occasionally with browned butter from bottom of roasting pan.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            While turkey is roasting, chop neck into 1-inch chunks with cleaver. Heat oil in medium saucepan over high heat until smoking. Add turkey neck, onions, carrots, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned, about 10 minutes total. Add stock, bay leaves, soy sauce, and marmite. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 1 hour then strain through fine mesh strainer. You should have a little over a quart of strained stock. If not, add water to equal 1 quart. Discard solids and set stock aside.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            After turkey is cooked, transfer V-rack back to clean rimmed baking sheet. Pour hot melted butter from bottom of pan over turkey. Tent with foil and allow to rest for at least 30 minutes before carving. Increase oven heat to 350°F and set a rack in the middle. Roast extra tray of stuffing while turkey rests. Meanwhile, set roasting pan over burner and add reserved stock. Scrape up browned bits with wooden spoon. Pour stock through fine mesh strainer set in 1 quart glass measure.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Finely chop turkey gizzard and liver (if desired). Melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter in medium saucepan. Add chopped giblest and cook, stirring frequently, until just cooked through, about 1 minute. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Whisking constantly, add broth in thin steady stream. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until thickened and reduced to about 3 cups. Season to taste with salt and pepper.                                                                                                                            10                                                                            Remove stuffing bag from turkey and untie.

the four chicken thighs with salt and freshly ground pepper over and under the skin. Heat the oil in a medium pan with deep sides over medium high heat. When the oil begins to shimmer, add the thighs skin side down.\nCook at medium high for about 5 minutes, until the skin has a nice golden brown color. A few bits of skin may even stick to the pan. That’s ok.\nReduce the heat to medium. Let the chicken cook for another 15 minutes untouched. If the skin seems like it’s starting to burn, turn down the heat a little more. Flip and cook on the other side for about 5 minutes.\nWhen done, the skin should be crisp and golden and the chicken should have rendered about a 1/4 cup of fat (just eyeball it; you’ll be fine!). If you have more than 1/4 cup, reserve the extra for another purpose or discard.\nIt’s ok if the chicken isn’t entirely cooked through at this point -- your goal in this step is to render the fat from the chicken skin, and develop the browning in the pan and not necessarily cook the meat through.\n\nMeanwhile, bring 3 cups of water, bay leaf and good pinch of salt to a boil in medium sauce pan over medium high heat.\n\nMake the soup stock: Once you’ve finished rendering the fat from the chicken thighs, remove the pan from heat and transfer the thighs to the pot of boiling water. If your chicken isn’t completely covered with water, add more so it is. Leave the pot uncovered.\nReduce heat under the pan of water so it comes down to a gentle simmer. Cook the chicken for 9-11  minutes, until the chicken is cooked all the way through. Skim any foam from the top of the water.\n\nStrain the soup stock: Remove the chicken from the pot of water. Put on plate and set aside to cool.\nStrain stock through fine mesh strainer into a liquid measuring cup. You should have somewhere between 2 to 4 cups of chicken stock. Measure out 2 1/4 cups of the stock and set aside (add water if needed to make this amount; if you have more stock than needed, save the leftover for another recipe.)\n\nMake the roux: Return the pan with the rendered chicken fat to medium heat. While whisking constantly, sprinkle flour a little at a time over the fat until all the flour is mixed in and you have a white paste.\nKeep whisking continuously until the roux turns a golden color, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped onion and the minced garlic – the roux will get crumbly when you add the vegetables, and that’s ok. Keep whisking for about 5 more minutes until the onions are cooked through. It will smooth out again when you add the stock.\n\nMake the creamy soup base: While whisking continuously, slowly pour the 2 1/4 cups of stock into the pan with the roux. At first, it will have the consistency of paste with clumps of onion in it. Just keep whisking and slowing adding the stock. At this point your soup may look a little watery, and you could even see fat around the edges of the pan. That’s ok.\nOnce all the stock is added, increase the heat to medium high and whisk for about 8 minutes until the liquid is noticeably thicker than syrup, but thinner than ketchup.\nReduce the heat to medium. Keep an eye on the soup while you do the next step (shredding the chicken) so that it stays warm but doesn’t boil. Whisk the soup occasionally.\n\nAdd the chicken: Pull the meat off two of the chicken thighs, and chop it finely; you should have 3/4 to 1 cup of chicken meat. Save the remaining two chicken thighs for another meal.\n\nFinish the soup: Slowly whisk in the heavy cream. Taste and add additional salt and pepper as needed, to taste.\nThe soup can be used immediately. Alternatively, cool and store in fridge for up to four days.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Render the fat from the chicken: Sprinkle the four chicken thighs with salt and freshly ground pepper over and under the skin.","ingredients":[{"id":5091,"name":"chicken thighs","image":"chicken-thigh.jpg"},{"id":1002030,"name":"ground black pepper","image":"pepper.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat the oil in a medium pan with deep sides over medium high heat.

Buttery chardonnay is great for scallops, shrimp, crab, and lobster, while muscadet is a classic pick for mussels, oysters, and clams. If you've got some spice in your shellfish, a semi-dry riesling can balance out the heat. One wine you could try is Chehalem INOX Chardonnay.

The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents. Very pleased.","price":"$12.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442371-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.82,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.7673684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fchehalem-inox-chardonnay-2009%2F109305"}]},"instructions":"1.

one wine will suit every pasta dish.

Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Cook the pasta in a large stockpot of generously-salted water al dente according to package directions.
