Add in egg and vanilla extract and process to combine.Add in flour and salt and process just until incorporated. Scrape out dough onto a piece of plastic wrap, flatten out into a rectangle, wrap and refrigerate for about an hour until firm.Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Place six 4” tart tins on a baking sheet.Roll out dough to 1/16” inch. Cut circles and carefully fit into tart tins, pressing into bottom and sides. The dough should reach up at least 1” on the side. Refrigerate tart tins for about 10 minutes.Bake for 15 minutes until crusts are dry and just turning golden on the bottom. Remove from oven and let cool while you are making the filling.For the filling:Combine sugar and water in a small saucepan. Bring to boil over high heat on stove. Remove and let cool to room temperature.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Whisk eggs and custard powder together in a medium bowl. Add in evaporated milk and whisk to combine.Add in sugar syrup and vanilla extract and whisk to combine.Strain mixture into a measuring cup to get rid of any lumps and foam on top.Fill tart crusts about 80% full.  Bake for about 10 minutes in the oven.Turn heat down to 375 degrees F. Bake for 5 minute increments, checking to see if filling has set. It should take about 10 minutes more. If the filling starts to bubble, crack the oven door open a couple inches to let the filling deflate. If the crusts are browning too much, you may need to put some foil over the crusts to protect them.The top of the filling should look mostly set. The center may still look slightly jiggly.

Press to compact.Beat cream cheese until smooth, about 30 seconds, using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a hand mixer. Beat in sour cream, egg, sugar, and vanilla. Beat until no lumps remain. (Its helpful if all ingredients are room temperature before starting!)Melt semi-sweet baking chocolate in a small bowl on high power in 30 second increments, stirring between each, until melted and smooth. Place 1/4 cup of the cheesecake batter into the chocolate mixture and stir to combine.Divide the remaining plain cheesecake batter evenly on top of the crusts (about 1 tablespoon per muffin cup).

Then place the pan into the freezer for 30 minutes.\n\nBlind bake the crust. Preheat oven to 400°F. After 30 minutes, remove the pan from the freezer and gently remove the foil from the dough. Place the pan on top of a sheet of foil (to catch drippings) on top of a baking sheet. Prick the bottom of the tart dough with the tines of a fork in several places and place the tart pan in the oven. Bake for 15 -20 minutes, or until the dough is lightly browned. Remove from oven and let sit at room temperature to cool.\n\nMake the filling. Put the butter, brown sugar, egg, and salt in a large bowl. Stir until well combined. Then gently stir in the pecans. Pour the filling into the pre-baked, cooled tart shell.\n\nBake the tart. Preheat oven to 350°F. Place the tart on a foil lined pan and bake for about 25 minutes until lightly browned and slightly puffy all over. Remove from oven and let cool to touch. Then while the tart is still slightly warm, gently remove the outer ring of the tart pan, leaving the tart on the metal tart pan bottom. Let cool all the way before cutting to serve.\nServe with whipped cream. Use a sharp chef's knife to cut the tart. You have to cut through pecans, so make strong, swift cuts.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the dough.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Combine in a food processor the flour, sugar, and salt.

To the egg mixture, alternately add the flour mixture and the milk mixture beginning and ending with flour. With the mixer off, scrape down the sides of the bowl after each addition. With the mixture at a low speed add the cocoa. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and pour this mixture into the prepared cake pans. Bake the cake for approximately 15 minutes or until tester comes out clean. When cake layers have cooled, remove from pans and refrigerate until cold.                          To make the frosting: In an electric mixing bowl place the soft butter and beat it on a low speed while adding powdered sugar. When all the sugar is mixed in, turn off the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add in the vanilla and salt and let the mixer beat for 5 to 7 minutes on a medium speed. Fill and frost the cake and refrigerate it for 10 to 20 minutes to set up the frosting.                          To make the ganache: In a heatproof bowl, place the chocolate chips and the corn syrup. Bring the heavy cream to a full boil. Pour the cream over the chocolate and whisk it until smooth then set it aside.Pour ganache over the top of the cake and, with a cake spatula, smooth the top of the cake and allow ganache to spill over the sides. Refrigerate for 20 minutes or longer.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.                          For the Crust:                          In a mixing bowl, combine the ingredients with a fork until evenly moistened. Lightly coat the bottom and sides of an 8-inch springform pan with non-stick cooking spray.                          Pour the crumbs into the pan and, using the bottom of a measuring cup or the smooth bottom of a glass, press the crumbs down into the base and 1-inch up the sides. Refrigerate for 5 minutes.                          For the Filling:                          In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese on low speed for 1 minute until smooth and free of any lumps. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and continue to beat slowly until combined. Gradually add sugar and beat until creamy, for 1 to 2 minutes.                          Add sour cream, lemon zest, and vanilla. Periodically scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beaters. The batter should be well-mixed but not over-beaten. Pour the filling into the crust-lined pan and smooth the top with a spatula.                          Set the cheesecake pan on a large piece of aluminum foil and fold up the sides around it. Place the cake pan in a large roasting pan. Pour boiling water into the roasting pan until the water is about halfway up the sides of the cheesecake pan; the foil will keep the water from seeping into the cheesecake. Bake for 45 minutes. The cheesecake should still jiggle (it will firm up after chilling), so be careful not to overcook. Let cool in pan for 30 minutes. Chill in the refrigerator, loosely covered, for at least 4 hours. Loosen the cheesecake from the sides of the pan by running a thin metal spatula around the inside rim. Unmold and transfer to a cake plate. Using a spatula spread a layer of Warm Lemon Blueberry topping over the surface.                          Slice the cheesecake with a thin, non-serrated knife that has been dipped in hot water. Wipe dry after each cut.                          In a small saucepan add all the ingredients and simmer over medium heat for 5 minutes or so until the fruit begins to break down slightly. Leave to cool before spreading on cheesecake.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":325,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]}]},{"name":"For the Crust","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a mixing bowl, combine the ingredients with a fork until evenly moistened.

Wrap the dough in plastic and chill in the refrigerator for two hours or overnight.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Generously flour work surface and rolling pin. Divide dough in half and return half to refrigerator. Roll dough out into a long, thin rectangle. It will be very soft and sticky; flour as necessary. Trim edges of dough and cut into 4x2-inch rectangles. Transfer to baking sheet. Reroll scraps and cut more rectangles. You should have a total of 12 to 14. Use tines of fork to poke 5 rows of holes down the center or each cracker. Crimp the edges. Sprinkle with granulated sugar (if using). Repeat with the second half of dough.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Transfer baking sheets to refrigerator and chill for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350ºF. Bake crackers until lightly browned around edges and slightly firm to the touch, about 15 minutes, rotating baking sheets halfway through. Cool graham crackers completely on rack, then transfer to airtight container. They will keep for about one week.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine flour, ground walnuts, brown sugar, baking soda, and salt in food processor and pulse to blend.","ingredients":[{"id":18372,"name":"baking soda","image":"white-powder.jpg"},{"id":19334,"name":"brown sugar","image":"dark-brown-sugar.png"},{"id":12155,"name":"walnuts","image":"walnuts.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"food-processor.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles wet sand.","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Combine maple syrup, milk, vanilla extract, and maple extract (if using) in small bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":2050,"name":"vanilla extract","image":"vanilla-extract.jpg"},{"id":12111111,"name":"maple extract","image":"vanilla-extract.jpg"},{"id":19911,"name":"maple syrup","image":"maple-syrup.png"},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"milk.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Add to flour mixture and pulse just until dough comes together.
