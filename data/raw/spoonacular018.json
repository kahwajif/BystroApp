Note - a large cauliflower will make a LARGE crust! Go smaller and use only 1 egg if you want to serve fewer people.Put the cauliflower florets in afood processor and pulse until crumbs remain - you want it to almost look like snow. Place all of the cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl and cover it with a paper towel. Microwave for 5 minutes. Remove the cauliflower and spread it on a towel to cool.Once cool, wrap the cauliflower in a towel and squeeze every last bit of water and liquid out of it over your sink. When you think you're finished, squeeze again! You want all of the moisture out. Place the cauliflower in a large (dry) bowl. Stir in the cheeses, seasonings and spices and eggs, mixing until combined. You want to end with a ball of cauliflower dough, so you might need to use your hands to pull it together.Place the dough ball on a piece of parchment paper (no larger than your pizza stone) and press the dough into a circle, making sure the crust is thin. I like to go about 1/4 inch in thickness. Gently pick up the parchment paper and place the entire crust (parch and all) on your pizza stone. Bake for 10 t0 12 minutes, or until golden. They key here is make the crust crisp and sturdy enough so it doesn't crumble or break apart.Once the crust is golden, (gently) remove it and cover it in your desired toppings. I do sauce first, then cheese and everything listed about, along with more cheese on top. Make the pizza however you'd like! Very carefully transfer the pizza (again, still on parchment) back to the pizza stone. Have someone else help you or use a pizza peel. Bake the pizza for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly. Cover with extra parmesan. Serve immediately!Note: large slices are difficult to *pick up* - you may need a knife and fork.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F and place a pizza stone inside.

The 2007 Russian River Selection Pinot Noir shows wonderful balanced acidity and generous fruit that will pair beautifully with grilled rosemary pork tenderloin.","price":"$41.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438237-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":58,"score":0.7942857142857144,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fgary-farrell-russian-river-pinot-noir-2007%2F102829"}]},"instructions":"Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl and gently toss to combine.

Drain them once more, and set them aside.Toss sweet potato with oil and roast at 425 F for 45 minutes, until tender.  Turn once or twice.While the peas boil and the potatoes roast, melt 2 tablespoons bacon fat in a cast iron skillet over medium heat.  Stir in onions and fry until translucent and fragrant - 3 to 5 minutes.  Stir in greens and continue cooking until tender - about 8 minutes.Combine peas, collards and onions with arrowroot powder, paprika, cayenne and salt in a food processor and process until they form a uniform mash.  Fold in the roasted sweet potato.Take the mash by hand and form it into 6 patties about 4 inches in diameter and 1/2-inch thick.  Wrap them in bacon.Melt remaining 2 tablespoons bacon fat in a cast-iron skillet.  Fry the patties in batches, about 5 minutes on each side.

To Make the Cookies: With a mixer on medium speed, beat the butter until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the brown sugar and beat at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium, add the egg and the vanilla extract, and beat to combine. Reduce the speed to low, add the flour and the salt, and mix just until a soft dough forms. Divide the dough in two, shape into disks, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line at least two baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat; set aside. Working with one disk at a time, roll out the dough to about 1/8-inch thickness. Using a 2½-inch diameter round cutter, cut out the rounds and place them on the prepared baking sheets, about ½ an inch apart. Refrigerate the cookies (on the baking sheets) for 10 minutes.3. Bake the cookies for 10 to 12 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool on the pans for a couple of minutes, and then move to a cooling rack to cool completely.4. To Make the Marshmallow Filling: Using a mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the the egg whites with the cream of tartar and the salt until firm peaks form, gradually increasing from medium-low speed to medium-high speed as the egg whites gain volume. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, boil the corn syrup over high heat without stirring until it registers 230 to 235 degrees F on a candy thermometer (thread ball stage). Slowly drizzle the hot corn syrup into the egg whites and beat at high speed until glossy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium-low, beat in the vanilla extract and the powdered sugar.5. Using either a pastry bag or a spoon, mound about 1½ tablespoons of marshmallow filling into the center of a cookie. Top with another cookie and press lightly to spread the marshmallow to the edges. Add another mound on top of the second cookie, and top with another cookie, again pressing slightly to spread the filling to the edges. Repeat with the rest of the cookies.6. To Make the Chocolate Coating: Using a double boiler or in the microwave on 50% power and in 30 second increments, melt the chocolate and vegetable oil together until completely smooth. Place the assembled cookies on a wire rack set over a sheet of wax paper. Spoon the melted chocolate over each cookie so that it runs down the sides and covers most of the cookie. Allow to set at room temperature for about 2 hours (or refrigerate to speed up the process). Store in an airtight container at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To Make the Cookies: With a mixer on medium speed, beat the butter until creamy, about 3 minutes.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404726,"name":"blender","image":"blender.png"}],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Add the brown sugar and beat at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.

Mix the onion powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika, cumin, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl. Dry rub both sides of the brisket with the seasoning mixture.Stir together the honey barbecue sauce and brown sugar.Pour half of the sauce into the bottom of your slow cooker. Place the seasoned brisket, fatty side up, into the slow cooker. Don't worry if it's a little big for the cooker, the brisket will shrink as it cooks. Cover the top o the brisket with the remaining sauce.Cover the slow cooker and set heat to low for 9 hours, or until fork tender.When the brisket is cooked, remove it carefully from the slow cooker and place it on a cutting board. Pour the sauce from the slow cooker into a large bowl and let it cool.Slice off the fat cap from the top of the brisket and discard.Flip the brisket over so the leaner side faces upward. You'll be able to see the direction of the meat grain better on this side. Slice the brisket against the grain, at a slight diagonal, creating thin slices of meat.Skim the fat that has risen to the top of the sauce in the large bowl. It will appear lighter in color than the sauce, like droplets of oil on the surface. Skim as much fat as you can.In a small bowl, stir together cornstarch and 1 tbsp of water till completely smooth. Pour the cornstarch mixture into the bowl of sauce and stir to combine.Pour half of the sauce back into the slow cooker. Layer the slices of brisket meat on top of the sauce. Pour the remaining sauce over the brisket.Turn slow cooker to high for about 1 hour, till the meat and sauce are heated through and the sauce begins to bubble and thicken. Keep on warm setting till ready to serve.Note: the longer you cook this brisket, the more it will take on the texture of shredded or \"chipped\" beef. If you'd like for the meat to retain its sliced shape, no need to return the meat to the slow cooker. You can reduce the sauce quickly in a saucepan on the stovetop, then pour it over the slices in a casserole dish before serving. The leftovers make great BBQ beef sandwiches.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Sprinkle brisket with salt and pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix the onion powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika, cumin, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl.
