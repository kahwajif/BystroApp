Grease two 8 cake rounds. Line them with parchment paper and then grease the pans again, then flour them. (See note)Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.Add melted butter to a large bowl and mix in sugar with a hand mixer for 30 seconds until thick and yellow. Add eggs one at at time, beating after each addition. Beat in vanilla bean paste.Add the flour mixture and buttermilk alternately, starting and ending with the flour. Dont over mix! Divide batter among cake pans. Bake for 24-28 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool completely before removing from pans to frost.At this point, you can decide how you want to fill the cake. You can use the two layers as-is or you can torte them for a 4-layer cake. Note: if you do not torte the layers, you can cut the recipe for the peanut butter filling in half.Make the filling: beat peanut butter with 1 cup of powdered sugar (using a hand or a stand mixer). Add the second cup of powdered sugar and mix, the mixture will be crumbly. Add vanilla and 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream. Mix until smooth. Add another 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream and mix until smooth. Add the rest of the heavy whipping cream a little bit at a time and beat until the mixture becomes a frosting like texture. (Youll notice a change - it will go from thick like a peanut butter cup to smooth like frosting during that last addition of the cream.)Place the bottom cake layer on serving plate. Divide your filling and fill between each layer.Make the frosting: mix cocoa and melted butter with a hand mixer. Add powdered sugar (1 cup at a time) and optional salt, if using. Mix between powdered sugar additions - the mixture will be clumpy. Add the vanilla and 1 ounce of the heavy whipping cream. Mix until smooth. Continue adding the heavy whipping cream until your desired thickness has formed - about 3 ounces (just over 1/4 cup).Use a small amount of frosting to create a crumb coat on the outside of the cake. This will ensure that you will not have cake crumbs in your final frosting layer. The crumb coat just uses a very small amount of frosting and is very thin all over the cake. Then frost as normal using the remaining frosting. Top with sprinkles, if desired.The cake is best served at room temperature but I would store it in the refrigerator if you make it ahead of time, then let it come to room temperature before serving. Can be made up to 1 day ahead.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350F. Grease two 8 cake rounds.

Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":435067,"title":"Boutari Moschofilero","description":"Boutari Moschofilero (mo-sko-FEEL-ero) is a premium white wine made from 100% Moschofilero grapes grown in high elevation vineyards in the AOC region of Mantinia in the Peloponnese.For years Boutari Moschofilero has been an important selling white wine in Greece and, until recently, a virtual unknown in the United States. The Boutari winery's vinification of Moschofilero is a breakthrough for Greek wines...and it just might be the start of the next white wine revolution! This is a fresh white wine with intense floral (white rose) and fruity (melon and citrus trees) aromas.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/435067-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":5,"score":0.7375,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fboutari-moschofilero-2006%2F91926"}]},"instructions":"<ol><li>In

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Brush quartered squash all over with a drizzle of olive oil and sprinkle with a pinch sea salt. Lay squash pieces side down in oven, cover tightly with foil and cook until fork tender, 40 - 50 minutes. Use caution when opening foil  the steam plume can be hot.When squash is cool enough to handle, scoop flesh from skin and mash with a fork until smooth. Measure 1 2/3  cups mashed squash. Reserve the rest for another use. Use a fork to mix Parmesan into mashed squash. Taste and add sea salt and pepper as needed. Fold in eggs. Set aside while you prepare dough.To make ravioli dough, on a large lightly floured board or counter, form a flour mound with 3 cups flour and make a deep well in the center. Crack eggs into a bowl, add milk, and tip into flour well. Gently, whisk eggs with a fork. As you go, slowly incorporate more and more flour. Once eggs and flour are fully incorporated, use your hands to fold flour into mixture. Dough should not be sticky at all  continue folding in flour, adding up to 1/2 cup more as needed. Once dough is no longer sticky, clean the work surface with a pastry scraper and knead dough 8 minutes, until it is very smooth to the touch.Divide into 8 equal pieces. Wrap 6 tightly with plastic and keep at room temperature. Cover 1 of the remaining 2 pieces with a tea towel. Set pasta roller to widest setting. Stretch dough into a 5 x 3-inch rectangle. With widest side parallel to the rollers send the dough through several times. Tighten rollers one notch at a time and repeat. When dough reaches 1/16-inch thick and is roughly a 5 x 13-inch rectangle, lay out on a lightly floured surface and roll the second piece of dough.If making ravioli by hand, lay dough rectangle out, dot with about 1 tablespoon filling at 1-inch intervals on 1 side only. Brush edges with water. Fold dough over, press around filling, and then cut with a fluted ravioli cutter or sharp knife.If using a ravioli maker, lay sheet of dough across metal ravioli mold. Use the plastic mold to press divots for ravioli filling. Add filling. Top with second sheet of dough. Roll over layers with a rolling pin several time until ravioli are sealed. Turn over, and gently release ravioli from mold. Use a ravioli cutter or sharp knife to separate individual ravioli.Repeat for remaining dough and filling.Before cooking ravioli, make lemon-thyme butter.

Lay squash pieces side down in oven, cover tightly with foil and cook until fork tender, 40 - 50 minutes. Use caution when opening foil  the steam plume can be hot.When squash is cool enough to handle, scoop flesh from skin and mash with a fork until smooth. Measure 1 2/3  cups mashed squash. Reserve the rest for another use. Use a fork to mix Parmesan into mashed squash. Taste and add sea salt and pepper as needed. Fold in eggs. Set aside while you prepare dough.To make ravioli dough, on a large lightly floured board or counter, form a flour mound with 3 cups flour and make a deep well in the center. Crack eggs into a bowl, add milk, and tip into flour well. Gently, whisk eggs with a fork. As you go, slowly incorporate more and more flour. Once eggs and flour are fully incorporated, use your hands to fold flour into mixture. Dough should not be sticky at all  continue folding in flour, adding up to 1/2 cup more as needed. Once dough is no longer sticky, clean the work surface with a pastry scraper and knead dough 8 minutes, until it is very smooth to the touch.Divide into 8 equal pieces. Wrap 6 tightly with plastic and keep at room temperature. Cover 1 of the remaining 2 pieces with a tea towel. Set pasta roller to widest setting. Stretch dough into a 5 x 3-inch rectangle. With widest side parallel to the rollers send the dough through several times. Tighten rollers one notch at a time and repeat. When dough reaches 1/16-inch thick and is roughly a 5 x 13-inch rectangle, lay out on a lightly floured surface and roll the second piece of dough.If making ravioli by hand, lay dough rectangle out, dot with about 1 tablespoon filling at 1-inch intervals on 1 side only.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":1033,"name":"parmesan","image":"parmesan.jpg"},{"id":1012047,"name":"sea salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"egg.png"},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"milk.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":221439,"name":"kitchen towels","image":"dish-towel.jpg"},{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"},{"id":404765,"name":"aluminum foil","image":"aluminum-foil.png"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}],"length":{"number":58,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Brush edges with water.

set aside. Recipe could be made as mini loaves or muffins; baking times will vary. Bread - To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or large mixing bowl and electric mixer) , add the butter, sugars, eggs, vanilla, and beat on high power until creamed, light, and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the sour cream, and beat on high power to incorporate, about 1 minute. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add 1 1/2 cups flour, cinnamon, baking powder, optional salt, and beat on low until just incorporated, about 1 minute; don't overmix. Set aside. To a small bowl, add the cinnamon chips, sprinkle with 2 tablespoons flour, and toss with your fingers or a spoon to coat chips in flour. Flouring them helps prevent sinking while baking. Add contents of small bowl (chips and any excess flour) to large mixing bowl and beat on lowuntil just incorporated, about 1 minute; don't overmix. Turn batter out into prepared pans, divided evenly. Batter is thick. Smooth the tops of pans lightly with a spatula; set aside. Topping - To a small bowl, add sugar, cinnamon, and stir to combine. Using a small spoon, evenly sprinkle topping mixture over the loaf pans. Bake for about 45 to 50 minutes (I baked 48), or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs, no batter. However, the toothpick test is tricky because you'll likely hit cinnamon chips which are melty and gooey. Bread will be domed, likely with a crack down the center, and will be firm when touched lightly when done. Allow bread to cool in pans on a wire rack for about 15 minutes before inverting (do it over a paper towel to catch the cinnamon-sugar topping) and allowing to cool completely on a rack before slicing and serving. Bread will keep airtight at room temp for up to 1 week and in the freezer for up to 6 months.

Sprinkle the yeast on top and allow it to sit for 5 minutes or until it begins to foam.Secure the hook attachment to the stand mixer, then add the flour and butter to the bowl and mix on low until the ingredients are combined.Increase the speed to medium and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, 4 to 5 minutes.Remove the dough from the bowl. Clean the bowl and then grease it with vegetable oil.Return the dough to the bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and place it in a warm place for 1 hour, or until the dough has doubled in size. (Watch my video for how to proof bread in the dryer.)Preheat the oven to 450ºF and position the oven racks in the middle two positions in your oven.Line two sheet trays with lightly oiled parchment paper.Stir together the 10 cups of water and the baking soda in an 8-quart pot. Bring the mixture to a rolling boil.While the water comes to a boil, turn the dough onto your work surface and divide it into 12 equal pieces. (Do not flour your work surface; See Kelly's Notes.) Applying even pressure, roll out each piece of dough into an 18- to 20-inch rope. Fold each rope in half, twisting the two pieces around one another and pressing the ends together. Twist the bottom end around the top, feeding it through the top hole and pressing to secure. (See photos for shaping instructions.) Return the twists to the cookie sheet.One by one, carefully place each twist into the boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove each twist from the water using a large slotted spoon or spatula(s) and return it to the cookie sheet. Brush the tops of the twists with the egg wash and sprinkle with kosher salt (optional).Bake the twists until golden brown in color, 12 to 14 minutes, rotating the pans (between racks and turning to rotate pans) halfway through, then remove the twists from the oven and allow them to cool for 5 minutes before serving.Kelly's Notes:Do not flour your work surface prior to rolling out the pretzels or the dough won't have enough traction against the surface.

Line 14 muffin cups with liners.Over high heat, bowl the water in a small saucepan. Pour the unsweetened cocoa powder into a medium sized bowl and mix with boiling water until smooth. Allow to cool to room temperature by placing in the refrigerator as you prepare the other ingredients.Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium sized bowl. Set aside.In a large bowl, using an electric hand or stand mixer, cream the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating until smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla extract. Slowly add the flour mixture and beat only until *just* combined. In a steady stream, add the cooled cocoa mixture and stir until smooth.Fill each muffin tin 3/4 of the way full with batter. Bake for 16-19 minutes, keeping an eye on them to avoid even the slightest burning (which will lend dry cupcakes). My cupcakes took 17 minutes and a toothpick inserted in the middle came out clean. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool before frosting.Make the frosting: Beat softened butter on medium speed with an electric or stand mixer. Beat for 2-3 minutes until smooth and creamy. You want a very creamy base before adding anything else. See my extensive notes about this in the post above. Add 2 cups of powdered sugar and continue to beat on medium speed. The mixture will be fairly thick. Add the Nutella and continue to beat on medium speed. Add 3 Tablespoons of heavy cream and the vanilla extract. If the frosting is too thick, add more heavy cream (1 Tablespoon measurements at a time). If the frosting is too thin, add more powdered sugar (1/4 cup measurements at a time). Taste the frosting and add salt to cut the sweetness. I added about 1/4 teaspoon of salt to mine.Frost cooled cupcakes with frosting and decorate with candies as desired. Cupcakes taste best the day of or 1 day after they are made. Store covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the cupcakes: Preheat oven to 375F degrees.
