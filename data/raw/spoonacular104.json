Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour.2. Make the Filling: In a small saucepan, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch and ¼ cup of the water to form a paste. Stir in the remaining water, lemon juice and raisins. Set the pan over medium heat and cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens and the raisins plump, about 5 to 10 minutes. Cool to room temperature before using.3. Assemble and Bake the Cookies: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line three baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.4. Using about 1/3 of the dough at a time, roll out the dough on a well-floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. (The dough is very soft and sticky, so use as much flour as necessary to roll it out without it sticking.) Cut the dough into rounds (I used a 2¾-inch cookie cutter). Place one on prepared baking sheet, spoon 1 to 2 tablespoons of the raisin filling onto the circle and then top with another round of dough. Just lay the circle on top of the filling; there is no need to seal them shut, as they will do so while baking. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.5. Bake the cookies until lightly golden brown on top, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool for about 10 minutes on the pan and then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the Dough: Cream together the sugar and margarine on medium speed until light and fluffy.

are my top picks for Salmon. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. You could try Ghost Pines Sonoma County Napa County Monterey County Chardonnay.

Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 5-10 minutes or until sauce has thickened slightly. Remove from the heat and set aside.Place the salmon on a plate and rub with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Gently rub 2-3 tablespoons of the sauce on the salmon.Heat a medium size skillet over medium-high heat and add a tablespoon of olive oil. Once hot, add the red pepper slices, cabbage and carrots. Stir fry for 2 minutes and then drizzle about 2-3 tablespoons of the sauce over the veggies, toss well and continue to cook until the veggies are tender. Remove the veggies from the pan. Reduce the heat to medium and add another tablespoon of olive oil, now add the salmon, skin side facing up. Sear the salmon for 3-4 minutes and then flip and continue cooking for another 4-5 minutes or until the salmon reaches your desired doneness. Cooking times will vary depending on the size of your salmon. Chop the salmon into bites.To assemble the quesadillas, heat an electric griddle or skillet over medium heat. Add a bit of olive oil. Place 4 tortillas down on a clean counter, covering each with a bit of the sauce and then sprinkle with a bit of the cheese.Then evenly distribute the rice, top that with the veggies and then add the chopped salmon. Sprinkle with a little more of the cheese. Place the tortilla on the griddle or skillet, then cover with the other tortilla. Cook until the bottom is crispy and golden brown, then gently flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes until crispy and golden.Cut into fourths and serve with the spicy mangos and any remaining sauce or sweet thai chile sauce.

a rolling boil (1 Tbsp salt). Add the jumbo shells and cook until flexible but still quite firm (about 9 minutes if using Barilla shells).You want to undercook the shells at this point so they will be firm enough to stuff and will continue to cook when you bake the pasta dish.Drain in a colander and rinse in cold water to stop the cooking. Separate the shells so that they aren't folded into each other.2 Brown the sausage, onions, garlic:While the shells are cooking start on the sauce. Heat olive oil in a large saut pan on medium high heat. Break up the sausage with your fingers as you add it to the pan.Cook the sausage just until still a little pink, then add the finely chopped onions. Cook for a few minutes until the onions are translucent. Use a wooden spoon to break up the chunks of sausage into smaller bits.Add the garlic and cook a half minute more.3 Add tomatoes, water, parsley, salt, pepper: Add the canned crushed tomatoes and all of their juices to the sausage and onions. Add water (you can add water to the can, swirl it around to get what's left of the tomato juice in the can), chopped parsley, salt and pepper.Taste the sauce. If it tastes too acidic (this can happen, depending on the acidity of the tomatoes) you might want to add a teaspoon of sugar to balance the acidity.Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to the lowest temperature tokeep the sauce warm while you work on stuffing the shells.4 Make mint ricotta stuffing: In a medium bowl, mix together the ricotta, chopped mint, egg, salt, and pepper. 5 Stuff the shells: Use a spoon to stuff about a heaping tablespoon of mint ricotta stuffing into each of the pasta shells. 6 Layer sauce, shells, cheese in casserole dish:Preheat oven to 350F.

Line two cupcake pans with paper liners.  Set aside.In a medium mixing bowl, combine the cake flour, baking powder and salt.  Whisk together and set aside.  Add the butter to a large bowl.  Scrape the vanilla bean seeds into the bowl with the butter and discard the pod (or stick it in your sugar canister like I do.)  Beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed for 3 minutes, until light and creamy in color.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat for one more minute.Add the sugar to the butter mixture, ¼ cup at a time, beating 1 minute after each addition.  Mix in the eggs one at a time until incorporated.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl after each addition.  Combine the buttermilk and the vanilla extract in a liquid measuring cup.  With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients alternately with the wet ingredients, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients and mixing just until incorporated.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl and mix for 15 seconds longer.Divide the batter between the prepared paper liners, filling each about 2/3 of the way full.

Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Santa Cristina by Antinori Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":444296,"title":"Santa Cristina by Antinori Pinot Grigio","description":"The 2012 wine is deep straw-yellow in color.

Sauvignon Blanc are my top picks for Salmon. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes.

Process until smooth, about 30 seconds. Set aside 3/4 cup for the salad.      Thirty minutes before roasting the salmon, pour the remaining marinade over the salmon in a large rimmed dish and let sit at room temperature. (For the best texture, don't marinate longer than 30 minutes.)      While the salmon is marinating, position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 400F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil. When ready to roast the salmon, remove it from the marinade and set on the baking sheet. Bake until just firm to the touch and opaque in the center (use a paring knife to peek), 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest in the pan for 10 minutes.        Make the salad:           In a medium bowl, mix the cucumbers, onion, olives, cheese, and 1-1/2 tsp. salt. Toss with the reserved buttermilk dressing and season to taste with more salt and pepper.        Serve:     Use two large spatulas to carefully move the salmon to a platter. Spoon some of the cucumber salad around the salmon and serve the rest in a bowl on the side.    Make Ahead Tips    Prep the cucumber salad up to 3 hours ahead, but do not add the salt or dressing until just before serving.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Calories                        (kcal):                      230, Fat                        (kcal):                      7, Fat Calories                        (g):                      60, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      1, Protein                        (g):                      27, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      2.5, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      4, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      2, Sodium                        (g):                      340, Cholesterol                        (g):                      80, Fiber                        (g):                      0,                     Photo: Scott Phillips          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Marinate and roast the salmon","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a food processor, combine the buttermilk, basil, cilantro, scallions, vinegar, honey, ginger, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/8 tsp. pepper.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of the sugar. Use a large whisk to vigorously beat the yolks and sugar until they are pale, thick and creamy. (About 5 minutes.) Stir in the vanilla extract. In a very clean stand mixer bowl or a large mixing bowl, add the egg whites. Fit the mixer with the whisk attachment. Beat on medium high speed until soft peaks form. With the mixer running- gradually add the sugar. Continue to beat until stiff peaks form. Using a rubber spatula, pile about one-third of the egg whites into the yolk mixture. Gently fold them together until smooth. Add half of the flour and continue to gently fold, being careful to not deflate the egg whites. Repeat with another third of egg whites, the rest of the flour, and the last third of whites. Do not over-mix, but batter should be smooth, airy and fluffy.Pour the batter into the prepared pan.

In a deep saute pan, heat 1 cup of the canola oil over high heat until a deep-frying or candy thermometer reads 375F. In a bowl, combine the crabmeat, onion, scallions, bell pepper, mayonnaise, Tabasco, 1/4 cup of the bread crumbs, the lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix until fully incorporated. Form into cakes about 3 inches in diameter and 3/4 inch thick. Place the flour on a plate, and stir in the salt and pepper. Place the beaten egg in a bowl and the remaining 1 cup bread crumbs on another plate. Dredge each crab cake in the flour, then in the egg, and then in the bread crumbs. Lay the cakes in the oil and panfry until each cake has a nice brown crust on both sides, 5 to 6 minutes total. Transfer to paper towels to drain. 2. To Make the Salsa: Combine all the ingredients in a bowl, mixing gently. I like this have bright green chunks of avocado (which the lime juice keeps from turning brown), rather than to be a smooth guacamole concoction. Refrigerate the salsa until ready to use. 3. To Make the Mango Coulis: Place the mango chunks in blender with 1 1/2 cups water and the confectioners' sugar. Process until smooth. If the mixture is too thick, pour in another 1/4 cup water, and again check the consistency, adding up to another 1/4 cup water if necessary. Refrigerate the coulis until ready to use. 4. To Serve: Spoon coulis into the center of individual plates in a small bowl. Slice each crab cake in half to make two round pieces and lay the bottoms in the puree. Spoon some avocado salsa on top of each and place the top portions of the crab cakes over the salsa like a sandwich. Top with a small amount of salsa and garnish with cilantro sprigs. 5. Cat's Note: I've found the easiest way to cut a mango is to cut a fat slice off each side, moving your knife parallel to the broad side of the pit inside. You'll have mango thirds, with the two outer thirds free of the pit. With a sharp knife cut a checkerboard pattern in the flesh of the two outer thirds, slicing first in one direction and then the other without cutting through the skin. Then flip the mango piece inside out so the cut side is curving outward. You'll find the crosshatching you've done makes the chunks stand out so they're easy to cut away from the skin with a knife.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a deep saute pan, heat 1 cup of the canola oil over high heat until a deep-frying or candy thermometer reads 375F.

Line an 8x8-inch baking dish with parchment or aluminum foil, if using foil spray with cooking spray or brush with melted butter. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, granulated sugar, brown sugar and salt until well blended. Using a wooden spoon stir in melted butter and mix until combined. Add eggs and vanilla and stir until blended (mixture will be thick). Fold in 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Pour mixture into prepared baking dish and bake in preheated oven 35 - 37 minutes (underbake slightly as you'll be returning them to oven to cook marshmallows). Remove from oven and sprinkle top evenly with marshmallows then return to oven and bake about 4 minutes longer until marshmallows puff slightly. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes then toast tops of marshmallows with a kitchen torch if desired (be very carefully around parchment paper - I lit mine on fire. oops). Pour and spread chocolate frosting evenly over top (just after preparing frosting as it will begin to set as it cools), sprinkle top with remaining nuts. Allow to cool completely if desired (and if you have the patience to wait, it will take about 2 hours), or allow to cool slightly (you'll have runny frosting and unevenly cut brownies - but they are amazing this way). Cut into squares and store in an airtight container.For the chocolate frosting:In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Add milk and cocoa powder and cook whisking constantly until mixture has thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and using an electric hand mixer, stir in vanilla and powdered sugar. Use frosting immediately.Recipe Source: Cooking Classy","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Meanwhile, fry the onions in oil or butter until softened but not browned. Add the onions to the potatoes along with the cheese, holding back a little fried onion for garnishing. Season really quite generously with salt and pepper.Assemble the pierogi4. Divide the dough into several portions. Roll out 1 portion pastry dough on a lightly floured wooden board so it’s not too thick or too thin, about 1/8 inch is good. Using an inverted tumbler or biscuit cutter, cut out circles about 3 1/2 inches in diameter and place them on a floured wooden board or work surface, covering them with a towel until you’re ready to fill them. Repeat with the remaining dough.5. Place a heaping spoonful of filling in the center of each circle of dough. Fold the pastry in half and carefully close it, crimping the pastry with your fingers so you end up with little semicircles. (You can buy a simple hinged utensil to do this for you, if you prefer.)6. Place the sealed pierogi in a big pot of boiling water along with half a teaspoon salt. The moment the pierogi float to the top (this should not take more than a minute), use a slotted spoon to remove them and allow them to drain.

In a large bowl, stir together the buckwheat flour, all-purpose flour, and salt. In a small bowl, whisk the eggs until well blended; stir in the water and butter.2. Gradually whisk the egg mixture into the flour mixture until the batter is smooth. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. The batter should be the consistency of heavy cream. If it is too thick, whisk in additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time.Make the filling3. While the batter is resting, prepare the filling. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the onions; increase the heat to medium, and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add the apples and cook, stirring, for 10 to 15 minutes, until the apples begin to brown and have softened. Add the ham and sprinkle with the lemon juice, nutmeg, and salt. Cover and set aside until ready to fill the crepes.Make and assemble the crepes4. Heat a 9- to 11-inch crepe pan over medium-low heat until hot enough for a drop of water to sizzle on contact. Brush the surface of the crepe pan with a thin film of the melted butter. Blot any excess with the tip of a paper towel. Stir the crepe batter well with the whisk.5. Ladle about 1/3 cup of the batter into the heated pan, and simultaneously tilt and roll the pan from side to side to coat the surface with a thin layer of batter. Cook for 1 minute, or until the edges begin to set. Run the tip of a small narrow rubber spatula under the edges of the crepe to loosen it from the pan. Use your fingertips to lift the crepe and quickly flip it over. Cook the other side for 30 seconds, or until the batter is set into a thin pancake. Do not brown the crepe or cook it until crisp. Transfer the crepe to a large, round plate. Repeat with the remaining batter, brushing the pan with more butter if necessary. Stack the crepes as they are made. You should have 12 crepes. If making ahead, wrap the crepes in plastic wrap or aluminum foil to prevent drying out. The crepes can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.6. If the crepes have been made ahead, first fill them one at a time by warming each crepe in the pan over low heat. Otherwise, when the fresh crepe is cooked and still in the pan, sprinkle about 1/4 cup of the cheese in the center. Top the cheese with a large spoonful of the warm apple filling, spreading it into a single layer. Fold in two opposite sides of the circle to cover the filling. Then fold in the remaining two rounded sides, overlapping slightly, to form a square envelope. With a wide spatula, lift the crepe from the pan and invert it, so it is seam side down, onto a serving plate. Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm if not serving at once. Fill the remaining crepes in the same way. Reserve the remaining filling.7. Just before serving, brush the smooth top of each crepe with a thin film of the softened butter. Reheat the remaining apple filling and spoon a portion on top of each crepe. Serve at once.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the crepe batter","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"In a large bowl, stir together the buckwheat flour, all-purpose flour, and salt.

(this is one of those moments I wish I owned one of these to make the job a little easier). As always, stir and move the meat around as needed, but don’t overdo it such that the meat is unable to get nice and brown. Remember, caramelization = more flavor.Once the meat is fully cooked, scoop it out of the pan onto a large plate lined with a couple layers of paper towels. After it is cool enough to handle, use your fingers to crumble the meat into smaller pieces if needed (the finer the better). Mix together the cream cheese with the sausage in a bowl until well combined.Meanwhile, rinse the mushrooms under cold water to remove the dirt and then dry thoroughly with paper towels or a clean kitchen cloth. Remove the stems and discard (or, if you are more frugal and awesome than me, you could save the stems, chop ‘em up, and throw them in your next batch of tomato meat sauce). Set the mushrooms in a 9×13 glass baking dish, stem side up, and season with salt and pepper.In a small bowl, combine the Parmesan cheese, Panko bread crumbs, parsley, oregano, and salt and pepper to taste.Next is assembly. Fill each mushroom cap with a heaping tablespoon of the sausage and cream cheese mixture and cover with a generous amount of the cheese and breadcrumb topping.  Once all the mushrooms have been filled and topped, drizzle them with a little extra virgin olive oil (you could also put the oil in a misto and spray them generously).
