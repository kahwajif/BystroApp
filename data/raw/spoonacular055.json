Pour roughly half your chocolate mixture evenly into 4 silicone cupcake molds sitting on a plate. Tilt each cupcake mold around so that the chocolate mixture coats the edges a little.

Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes.

Mash well. Mix in the brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, milk, butter, eggs and bourbon (if using) until fully combined.Pour the sweet potatoes into a greased casserole dish (I used an oval).In a bowl, combine pecans, 2 tablespoons melted butter, flour and sage. Spread the pecan topping over top of the sweet potatoes. Bake for 30-40 minutes or until the pecans are golden.Just before the casserole is done, make the marshmallow like topping. Place egg whites, maple syrup, and cream of tartar in the heatproof bowl of an electric mixer. Set over a saucepan with simmering water. Whisk constantly until whites are warm to the touch, 3 to 4 minutes.Remove the bowl from the water and transfer to your stand mixer. Using the whisk attachment, whip the whites until stiff and glossy peaks form, 5 minutes. Add the vanilla, and mix until combined. Use immediately. Be careful not to over whip the mixture or the whites will get clumpy. Spoon the marshmallow into a gallon size ziplock bag and snip the corner off. Pipe the marshmallow onto the casserole (or just spread over the casserole with a spatula) and then toast using a kitchen torch OR under the broiler for 30 seconds to 1 minute (watch close as the broiler works quick!). Serve warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F.Poke a few holes in the sweet potatoes and bake for 1 hour or until soft and tender.

Set aside.Preheat the grill to medium high.While the grill preheats make the mango fried rice, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Toss in the cashews and dry toast them for about 5 minutes, flipping occasionally. They should be slightly browned in some spots, but its okay if theyre unevenly browned, you dont have to be too precise about it. Transfer cashews to a large plate.Add 1 tablespoon of oil and the red pepper. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until the red pepper is seared.

The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.This wine has a broad range of food pairings, whether alone with some well chosen cheeses, richer fish preparations or a good old steak on the barbeque.","price":"$42.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438099-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":8,"score":0.8400000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fdutton-goldfield-dutton-ranch-pinot-noir-2014%2F154141"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                Place asparagus in a large saucepan; add 1/2 in. of water.
