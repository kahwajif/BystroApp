Add the onions and garlic.In a small bowl combine the oregano, dill, paprika, cayenne, crushed red pepper, salt and pepper. Sprinkle the pork with half of the spice mixture.Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add a drizzle of olive oil. Once hot, add the pork and sear on all sides until golden brown (about 2 minutes per side). Try and get a really good caramelization on the meat.Add pork to the prepared crockpot and sprinkle with the remaining seasonings and any drippings from the pan. To the crockpot add the 1/3 cup olive oil, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, greek yogurt and 3/4 cup of water. Cover and cook on low, 8 hours. or high for 4-6 hours. If possible check the pork a few times during cooking. If needed add some water to keep the meat moist.To prepare the tzatziki pour any liquid off the surface of the greek yogurt. (I find it is best to use full fat greek yogurt for this, but 2% works ok as well. You want the yogurt to be thick, so if your greek yogurt seems thin strain it through a fine mesh strainer). Mix together the greek yogurt, diced cucumber, garlic, white wine vinegar, dill, oregano, salt and pepper to taste, and lemon juice. Drizzle with olive oil. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld.If making the tapenade, dice the olives and mix in a small bowl with the garlic, pepperoncini and parsley. Set aside in the fridge until read to serve.After 8 hours (or 4-6 on high) remove the pork and set aside to cool slightly. Once cool enough to touch shred the pork with two forks, it should fall apart easily. Return the pork to the crockpot and toss with the onions. Crank the heat to high.

A blend of approximately half Chardonnay and half Pinot Noir this crystal bright, light-bodied Champagne is elegant and distinctive. Opening with aromas of fresh pineapple, lemon and white florals, warming into complex scents of pear. A rich bouquet of white fruits end in subtle notes of honey and vanilla. The bead is intense with brisk effervescence, swirling up into a generous and persistent mousse. It is a balanced, extremely refined wine that, if properly stored, should keep for years, especially if bottled in magnums or jeroboams.Beyond the toasts and ship launchings, Champagne has a place at every dinner table. The 1996 Fleur de Champagne pairs is the perfect wine to serve with smoked oysters, game hens, delicate Japanese fish dishes, Fettuccini Alfredo or risotto. After a patient search for a master glassmaker capable of reproducing a bottle with the 1902 Gallé design, Perrier Jouët launched in 1969, its famous \"flower bottle\" with an arabesque design of anemones. The first bottles of Fleur de Champagne revealed a Champagne of vivacious delicacy, the epitome of the refined and engaging style of the Art Nouveau movement. Since then, it has been the signature Champagne of Perrier Jouët and is considered one of the world's most celebrated Champagnes.","price":"$129.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/433586-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8273684210526318,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fperrier-jouet-belle-epoque-1996%2F7383"}]},"instructions":"Pound thicker parts of chicken to an even thickness with the flat side of a meat mallet.

Stage 2: Sprinkle in the yeast and add 8 cups of flour. Stir to combine, then cover and allow to rise for 1 hour.                          Stage 3: After 1 hour, add the salt, baking powder, baking soda and remaining 1 cup flour and stir to combine. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes, then form into a ball, cover with a towel and allow to rise in a warm place for 30 to 45 minutes.                          Stage 4: Melt 2 sticks butter in a saucepan.                          Roll out the dough to 1/2 inch thick. Cut circles with a 2 1/2-inch cutter.

Stage 5: To parbake the rolls before freezing, bake until the rolls are risen and set but not brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Freeze the rolls separately, then store them in batches in freezer bags. (If you're not freezing the rolls and want to serve them right away, bake at 400 degrees F until risen, set and golden brown, about 15 minutes total.)                          When ready to cook and serve the frozen rolls, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt the remaining stick of butter in a saucepan.                          Place the frozen rolls on baking sheets and brush them with the melted butter. Bake until golden brown, 14 to 16 minutes.

              In a small saucepan, heat the milk, 1/2 cup water, sugar and honey to 105 to 110 degrees F. Add to the bowl of a stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the water mixture and wait for at least 10 to 15 minutes until the yeast blooms.                          In a separate saucepan over medium heat, add the butter and garlic and cook until the butter is melted and the garlic is fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.                          Combine the all-purpose flour and bread flour in a mixing bowl.                          Add the flour mixture to the bowl with the blooming yeast, and then add in the melted butter and garlic mixture. Mix on medium speed until the dough has come together and is smooth and elastic in texture and pulling away from the sides of the bowl, 5 to 7 minutes.                          Line 2 baking sheets with silicone mats.Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured cutting board and form into a ball. Cut into 4 equal pieces, and then cut those in half to form 8 equal pieces.

Once rested, lightly dust your work surface again and roll the balls into 7-inch logs.

Using a slotted spatula, remove the logs and place onto the prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle the logs with pretzel salt as they come out of the water, to ensure the salt sticks.

Reserve. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Cut the butter into small chunks and place in a large mixing bowl along with 1 1/2 cups sugar. Use an electric mixer to beat together the butter and sugar for a few minutes. Make sure the butter is fully integrated into the sugar and the mixture turns into small, even-sized crumbs. Add the eggs and oil to the bowl. Continue to mix until smooth.Add the Greek yogurt, vanilla and almond extract to the bowl. Use a spatula to stir the mixture till smooth.In a medium bowl, sift together 2  cups flour, baking soda, 1  tsp cinnamon,  tsp salt, nutmeg and cloves.Fold the dry ingredients into the wet to make a thick batter. Dont overmixa few lumps are okay.In the same medium bowl you used to sift the flour, sift together remaining  cup flour, 2 tbsp sugar and  tsp cinnamon.Drain the peeled apples and pat dry. Core the apples and dice them into small  inch chunks.Add the apple chunks to the flour, sugar and cinnamon mixture. Toss the apple chunks with the flour till evenly coated.Fold the apple chunks and walnuts into the cake batter. Grease two loaf pans with nonstick cooking oil spray. Divide the batter evenly between the two loaf pans.Combine streusel ingredients in a food processor and pulse till a crumbly topping forms. If you dont have a processor, chop the walnuts into very small pieces and mix them with the other streusel ingredients till the mixture is moist and crumbly.Sprinkle the tops of the two cakes evenly with streusel, half on each cake.Place the cakes into the oven. Bake for 60-70 minutes, turning once halfway through cooking, till the top is brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. If the top of the cake browns faster than it bakes, cover with foil for the remainder of baking time. Its a very moist cake, so err on the side of cooking it a little longer if youre unsure, using the foil to protect against burning.Let the cakes cool for 20 minutes in their pans, then gently release and place on a wire rack to cool completely. If the cakes will not release easily, you can also let them cool completely in the pan.To make the glaze icing, sift powdered sugar into a small mixing bowl. Use a whisk to mix the ingredients till a thick and creamy icing forms. You want the consistency of thick honey; if you need a little more moisture, add milk a few drops at a time. Just a drop can take it from a thick honey to a runny texture, so add with care. The thicker the frosting is, the more white it will dry... adding too much water will cause it to dry clearish, and it won't have that nice thick white look to it.Line a glass with a plastic bag, wrapping the edge of the bag around the outer rim of the glass. This will help you fill it with frosting. Use a spatula to scoop the frosting into the bag.Place cakes on top of a piece of parchment paper or paper towels to catch drips.Work the frosting into the corner of the bag and snip off a small corner with scissors. Gently squeeze and drizzle the frosting in a zig-zag pattern across the top of the cakes, using half of the icing for each cake.Let the icing dry for at least 30 minutes to set (it may take longer depending on the weather).Serve cake slices with a cup of tea or coffee. Sigh contentedly. Apple cake is good. Life is good.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Put peeled apples into a bowl of cold water mixed with lemon juice.

Riesling, and Sparkling rosé are my top picks for Mexican. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. One wine you could try is Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 43 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":438099,"title":"Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir","description":"The ripening season was classic Russian River, with warm days and cool nights—and with no major heat spells, the fruit ripening was perfect to give lush tannins, bright berry fruit and bright acidity. The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.This wine has a broad range of food pairings, whether alone with some well chosen cheeses, richer fish preparations or a good old steak on the barbeque.","price":"$42.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438099-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":8,"score":0.8400000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fdutton-goldfield-dutton-ranch-pinot-noir-2014%2F154141"}]},"instructions":"Turn on your oven to broil.
