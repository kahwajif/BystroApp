heat. Add one-third the onions and cook, stirring, until slightly wilted, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove to plate.Repeat twice with remaining oil and onions, removing each batch of onions to plate when slightly wilted.Return all onions to skillet. Add garlic, herbes de Provence, salt, pepper and bay leaf. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are tender and the consistency of a thick, chunky sauce, about 25 minutes.Remove from heat and cool slightly, stirring occasionally. Discard bay leaf.Preheat oven to 400°F. Lightly coat 15 x 10-inch baking pan with vegetable cooking spray. Unwrap phyllo, discard any torn sheets and immediately cover with plastic wrap to prevent drying. Remove wrap and lightly coat top sheet with cooking spray, starting from outside edge. Lift carefully and center on prepared pan.Repeat with remaining phyllo and more cooking spray, stacking sheets in pan. Gently ease phyllo into corners of pan, then fold or crimp edges to form 1/2-inch raised crust. Spread onion mixture evenly over phyllo, then sprinkle with olives.Bake until phyllo is golden brown and shrinks from edges of pan, about 20 minutes. For easy cutting, carefully slide pizza out of pan onto back of another baking pan. Using kitchen scissors, cut into rectangular slices.

Grease two large rimmed baking sheets and set aside. Place the popcorn in a really large bowl (or two separate large bowls if you don't have an extra big one). In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. When melted add the brown sugar, corn syrup, and cinnamon. Bring to a boil while stirring. Once the mixture starts boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring often, for 3 minutes. The mixture will be slightly thickened. Take the pot off the heat and stir in the vanilla and baking soda. The mixture will bubble so be careful. Pour the caramel over the popcorn and mix until the popcorn is evenly coated.Turn the popcorn out onto the baking sheets, spreading into an even layer on each sheet. Bake the popcorn for one hour, stirring and tossing every 20 minutes. Move the bottom tray to the upper rack and vice versa each time you stir. The popcorn will deepen in color and harden a bit as the caramel bakes and sets. When the popcorn comes out of the oven, scrape it onto an even layer of parchment or wax paper. Drizzle the white chocolate over the top (using the tines of a fork to drizzle it across or pour the melted chocolate into a freezer quart-size ziploc bag and snip a corner to drizzle).

Then, pour the spices into a spice grinder and grind them until you get a fine powder.                          In large bowl, whisk together the spice mixture you just made with the yogurt, oil, malt vinegar, salt, ground cinnamon, paprika, turmeric, cayenne pepper, garlic and ginger until well combined. It should smell amazing! Taste and adjust with more salt if it needs it.                          Reserve 1/3 cup of the marinade and set aside; you're going to make a sauce out of this reserved marinade.                          Prick the chicken thighs with a fork. Add the thighs to the rest of the marinade, and toss to coat. Marinate at least 1 hour in the fridge, and at most overnight.                          When you're ready to cook, line a baking sheet with foil, and turn your broiler on. Place each chicken thigh on the baking sheet, making sure each one is coated with the marinade, but isn't swimming in it. Cook the chicken thighs under the broiler until starting to blacken, about 5 minutes. Then turn the oven to 350, and cook until a meat thermometer inserted in the meatiest part of the thigh registers 160 degrees F, another 10 minutes. Remove from the oven.                          While the chicken is cooking, pour the reserved marinade into a small saucepan, along with 1/2 cup water and the honey. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-low heat, whisking all the time. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and pour into a small bowl or gravy boat for serving.

For your first batch, this can be store-bought kombucha tea, or a starter tea obtained from a kombucha brewing friend.  In a pinch, you can substitute vinegar.  Then, every time you make kombucha, reserve a small amount (about 1/2 cup) of finished fermented tea mixed with an equal part of distilled white vinegar.  This liquid is called \"starter tea.\"  Pour it over the kombucha starter culture (\"mother\") and store in the refrigerator.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Rinse out a medium stainless-steel sauce pan with distilled white vinegar. Add the water to the pan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. As soon as the water boils, add the sugar and stir to dissolve. Remove from the heat, add the tea bags, cover, and let sit for 20 minutes. Rinse a slotted spoon with vinegar and use it to remove the tea bags from the pot.Rinse a large (at least 1 1/2 quart) glass jar with distilled white vinegar.  Pour the sweet tea into the glass jar and let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Stir the starter tea into the sweet tea and add the starter culture (\"mother\"). Cover the jar with a coffee filter, cheesecloth, or other material that will keep out debris but allow air to circulate.  Secure with a rubber band.  Set in a warm, dark place to ferment for 8 to 12 days (a spot in the basement near a water heater works well).                                                                                                                              4                                                                            As the kombucha ferments a new starter culture (called a \"baby\") will form on the surface, while the mother will either float beneath it or sink to the bottom of the jar.  Strings may extend between the two cultures.  When the new baby is almost as big as its mother, it's time to taste-test the kombucha.  Stick a straw partway into the liquid, cover the end still in the air with a finger, and withdraw the straw from the liquid, thereby removing a dropperful.  Taste the kombucha that you've captured in the straw.  If it is refreshingly tart, it's ready.  If not, let the kombucha ferment longer.                                                                                                                              5                                                                            When the kombucha is fully fermented, preserve the starter culture and starter tea for your next batch of kombucha.  Rinse your hands with distilled vinegar, and then lift the mother and baby into a clean glass bowl or glass jar that has been rinsed with vinegar.  Pour 1/2 cup of the unfiltered kombucha over the culture, and add the 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar.  This liquid is starter tea.  Cover tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 to 2 months. (If you're using a jar for storage instead and it has a metal lid, cover the jar with a layer of plastic wrap first, before putting on the lid, to keep the contents from coming into contact with metal.)                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Filter the remaining kombucha through a damp coffee filter or several layers of damp cheesecloth into a clean glass jar.  Stir in the orange juice and seal the jar with a plastic or plastic-wrap-lined lid.  Let sit at room temperature for 2 to 4 days, until the kombucha is bubbly, and then chill for 24 hours. Serve over ice.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the kombucha starter tea: In addition to a starter culture, you will need a starter tea to brew kombucha.
