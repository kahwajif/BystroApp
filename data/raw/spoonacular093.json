Resift the sifted flour along with the baking powder, nutmeg, clove, cinnamon, and salt into a bowl. Now, resift the flour mixture and then set it aside.3. In another bowl, using an electric mixer on high speed, beat the butter until it’s soft and very pliant, about 1 minute (or 4 to 6 minutes by hand with a wooden spoon). Gradually add the granulated sugar and beat on high speed until the mixture is pale and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes (or 6 to 8 minutes by hand).4. One at time, add the 4 whole eggs and beat on high speed until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes (or 5 minutes by hand).5. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in 3 equal parts, beating on low speed or stirring with the wooden spoon until the batter is smooth and the flour is well combined with the butter mixture. Add the egg yolks and vanilla and continue to beat or stir until they’re well mixed into the batter.6. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the surface. Place on the middle oven rack and bake until a toothpick inserted into the thickest part of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour (though I’d recommend checking it after 45 minutes).7. Remove the pan from the oven and let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. If necessary, carefully run a thin knife around the perimeter and the inner rim of the cake to help loosen it from the pan. Invert the pan onto the rack and lift it off of the cake. Turn the cake right side up and let it cool on the rack.8. Transfer the cake to a serving platter.

Lift out the block using the parchment sling.\nTrim the ends of the truffle to square them off if you want. (And save the trimmings for yourself!) Cut the block in half through the middle to make two squares. Cut each square into thirds and then cut into fourth to make cubes. As needed to prevent sticking, wipe down your knife, dip it again in warm water, and wipe dry.\n\nCoat the truffles with cocoa. Place the sifted cocoa powder in a bowl. Carefully toss each cube cocoa powder. If you want to apply gold leaf, make sure to leave one of the sides clear so the leaf has something to stick to.\n\nApply the gold leaf (optional): Avoid touching the gold leaf with your fingers at it will stick to whatever it touches. Use a very dry, very clean paint brush to apply it to the truffles. Lightly brush or dab the surface of the gold leaf with your paint brush to \"grab\" some of the gold leaf, and then dab it on the surface of the truffle.

Add the onion and cook until tender, about 5-6 minutes. Add the minced garlic, chile powder, cumin, coriander, and oregano then stir constantly for 1 minute. Add diced tomatoes and juice along with the chicken broth. Season with sea salt and freshly cracked pepper, to taste and add the honey then cover with a lid and simmer for 30 minutes.After the sauce has simmered for 30 minutes, blend the sauce with an immersion blender (or regular blender) until smooth. Pour through a sieve to remove excess pulp, if desired. Taste and re-season if needed. Set asideWhile the sauce is simmering, caramelize the onions. Heat a tablespoon of oil into a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced onion and cook, stirring often, for 20-30 minutes, or until tender and caramelized. Side Note: If the onion gets too dry while cooking, add a few tablespoons of water to keep them moist. Season with sea salt and freshly cracked pepper, to taste. Set aside.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Coat a large 913 baking dish with cooking spray.Heat the remaining olive oil in the same skillet you cooked the onions in. Remove the silverskin from the pork tenderloin (click this link for instructions). Cut the pork into medallions then dice into bite sized chunks. Spread the diced pork out evenly on the cutting board. Sprinkle the pork evenly with a bit of sea salt, freshly cracked pepper, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, and coriander. Cook the pork in 2 batches, seasoned side down, in the hot pan. Season the other side of the pork then leave it alone for 2-3 minutes, until its caramelized then flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes. Remove to a plate and cover with a tin foil tent; cook the second batch of pork. Side Note: Pork will NOT be cooked through  it will finish cooking in the oven.Wrap the flour tortillas in a dishcloth then place into the microwave for 20-30 seconds or until the tortillas are pliable. Pour enough enchilada sauce to cover the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Place some of the pork, a spoonful of beans with sauce, and a spoonful of caramelized onions down the center of the tortilla. Roll and place seam side down in the baking dish. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and ingredients. Pour more sauce over each rolled enchilada then top with the cheese.Cover with tinfoil then place into the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil then continue to bake for 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted. Serve with chopped green onions on top along with diced avocado, sour cream, and hot sauce on the side.

salt, corn syrup, sugar and 1 cup of the cream. Over low heat, warm the ingredients until the butter is melted. Gently stirring during this part is ok to help combine the ingredients - just take care not to stir too vigorously and splash the liquid high up on the sides of the pan; also, take care to use low heat for this step. Too high of heat can cause the ingredients to melt unevenly and cause the butter to separate.Once the ingredients are warmed and melted, increase the heat to medium-low (I keep my stovetop dial between a 3 and 4 the entire time; each stove is different so just keep an eye on the heat). Because these are no-stir caramels, too high of heat will burn the ingredients on the bottom. Moderate the heat of your stove so that the mixture maintains a simmer without burning. If you turn down the heat and the caramel stops simmering, simply increase the heat little by little until a good simmer is reached and then leave it there. You'll be good to go.Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook, without stirring, until the mixture reaches 236 degrees F. Pour in the remaining 1 cup cream. Gently swirl the caramel once or twice with a wooden spoon or spatula to incorporate.Again, bring the mixture to a simmer (don't adjust the heat to sharply - I keep mine set the same as before) and cook until the thermometer registers 245 degrees F.Off the heat, carefully stir in the cinnamon and red food coloring.Immediately pour the caramel into the prepared pan - don't scrape the sides, just tip the pan until no more drizzles out. Let the pan of caramels cool completely at room temperature before cutting into pieces.To dip into chocolate, melt milk, semisweet or bittersweet chocolate in the microwave on 50% power for 1-minute increments or in a double boiler on the stove. Simply drop a caramel into the chocolate, lift out once full covered with a fork, tap on the side of the bowl to let the excess chocolate drip off and then carefully slide onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Once the chocolate has set, you can drizzle additional chocolate over the top for a nice pattern.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Butter an 8X8-inch pan and set aside.In a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the butter, salt, corn syrup, sugar and 1 cup of the cream.

Too high of heat can cause the ingredients to melt unevenly and cause the butter to separate.Once the ingredients are warmed and melted, increase the heat to medium-low (I keep my stovetop dial between a 3 and 4 the entire time; each stove is different so just keep an eye on the heat). Because these are no-stir caramels, too high of heat will burn the ingredients on the bottom. Moderate the heat of your stove so that the mixture maintains a simmer without burning. If you turn down the heat and the caramel stops simmering, simply increase the heat little by little until a good simmer is reached and then leave it there. You'll be good to go.Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook, without stirring, until the mixture reaches 236 degrees F.","ingredients":[{"id":19350,"name":"corn syrup","image":"corn-syrup.png"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":1053,"name":"cream","image":"fluid-cream.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404670,"name":"candy thermometer","image":"candy-thermometer.jpg"},{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"},{"id":404794,"name":"stove","image":"oven.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Pour in the remaining 1 cup cream.

a paring knife, make 6 slits along curve from top to bottom of each orange, cutting through peel but not into fruit. Using your fingers, gently remove peel. Reserve fruit for another use. Slice each piece of peel lengthwise into ¼-inch-wide strips. Using a paring knife, remove excess white pith from each strip and discard.Place strips in a large saucepan, and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, then drain. Repeat twice.Bring 4 cups sugar and 4 cups water to a boil, stirring occasionally until sugar dissolves. Stop stirring. Wash sides of pan with a wet pastry brush to prevent sugar crystals from forming. Add strips to boiling syrup, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer gently until strips are translucent, about 1 hour. Remove from heat, and let strips cool in syrup. (Strips in syrup will keep, covered and refrigerated, for up to 3 weeks).Using a slotted spoon, transfer strips to a wire rack placed on a rimmed baking sheet. Wipe off excess syrup with paper towels, then roll strips in sugar. Arrange in a single layer on a wire rack, and let dry for at least 30 minutes. Once dry chop each strip crosswise into ¼-inch dice; set aside.Make the ice cream: Half fill a large bowl with ice and water; set aside.Mix 2 ounces milk with the cornstarch in a small bowl. Stir until completely and smoothly incorporated; set aside.In a separate medium bowl whisk the cream cheese and salt together until well incorporated; set aside.Combine the remaining milk, cream, 2/3 cup granulated sugar, corn syrup, and ginger slices in a 4-quart saucepan, bring to a rolling boil over medium high heat. Remove from heat and gradually mix in the cornstarch mixture. Return to the heat and allow it to come back to a boil, whisking the entire time.  Remove from heat gradually whisk the hot milk mixture into the medium bowl with the cream cheese mixture. Keep whisking until it’s very smooth, add vanilla, cover and let the flavors infuse for 15 minutes.Pour the mixture into a 1-gallon Ziplock freezer bag. Seal the bag and submerge it in the bowl of ice water. Let the bag become well-chilled, about ½ hour. Replace the ice cubes as needed to keep the water very, very cold.Freeze the ice cream: Pour the chilled mixture through a fine mesh sieve directly into the bowl of the ice cream maker. Discard the ginger slices. Follow the manufacturer’s directions on the machine until the ice cream is smooth, thick and creamy. It should be pulling from the sides just a bit as it churns.Pack the ice cream into a 1-quart storage container, folding the candied orange peels in intermittently as you go.

The dough should be wet and resemble cottage cheese. Place the tapioca flour in a medium bowl. Scoop out 1/4 cup/60 ml of the dough and form into a ball. Place the ball in the tapioca flour and roll in the flour until covered. Shake off the excess flour by tossing the ball back and forth between your hands a few times. Set the dough ball along the edge of the prepared pan. Repeat with the remaining dough, placing each ball next to the previous one. Once the perimeter of the pan is filled with nine balls, arrange the remaining three balls in the middle. All the biscuits should be touching each other. They will be misshapen-don't worry, they will puff out in the oven. Bake until the biscuits are lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush the biscuits with melted butter.

Bring to a boil, and reduce heat to a low simmer. Cover and simmer until meat pulls away easily with a fork, about 3 hours.\n\nShred meat with two forks, then broil: Preheat oven broiler. Remove meat from the pot and put into a roasting pan. With 2 forks, tear the meat into large shreds, spreading them out in an even layer in the roasting pan. Put pan on the top rack of the oven. Broil for 5 to 10 minutes until edges and some parts are brown and crispy.\n\nSkim fat, reduce the salsa verde sauce: While the meat is browning in the oven, skim the fat from the liquid in the large pot. (Discard but do not put the fat down the drain or you will clog your pipes.)\nHeat the pot on high and vigorously boil the remaining liquid, stirring, until reduced to 2 1/2 cups, several minutes.\n\nReturn meat to sauce, stir in cilantro: Return the meat to the pot with the liquid. Stir in chopped cilantro. Season with salt.\nServe with heated and softened corn tortillas (20 seconds each in the microwave spread out over a paper towel will heat and softened packaged tortillas sufficiently), diced avocado, crumbed Cotija or grated Monterey jack cheese, sour cream (or crema fresca), and seasoned cabbage slaw.\nSeasoned Cabbage Slaw\nPlace thinly sliced cabbage in a medium sized bowl. Sprinkle with seasoned rice vinegar, salt and pepper. You can substitute white vinegar or apple cider vinegar for the rice vinegar, if you do, sprinkle on some sugar to help balance the acidity of the vinegar. Toss. Adjust seasonings. Let sit for 10 minutes for the cabbage to absorb some of the dressing.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Simmer pork with salsa verde, onion, stock, spices until tender: ","ingredients":[{"id":27028,"name":"salsa verde","image":"salsa-verde.png"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Put the pork, salsa verde, chopped onion, chicken stock, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, and oregano in a large, thick-bottomed pot, and heat on high heat.
