In a small saucepan, scald the milk over medium heat. Add butter, sugar and salt. Allow milk mixture to cool to warm. Add yeast and mix thoroughly. Let sit for 5 minutes.2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add milk/yeast mixture. Slowly add flour, one cup at a time, until the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl and forms a ball. Add water, a little at a time, until the dough combines. If the dough is still wet, add a little more flour. Knead dough for 5-10 minutes using the dough hook. Place dough in a large greased bowl. Cover and allow dough to rise for 2 hours or until dough has doubled in size.3. While the dough is rising, brush the chicken breast with 2 tablespoons of BBQ sauce and grill. Chop cooked BBQ chicken into small pieces and set aside.4. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. When the dough is ready, punch down the dough, knead briefly on a floured surface. Roll out the pizza dough, using a rolling pin. You want the dough to be about a 1/2 inch thick. Place dough in a buttered 10-inch sauté' pan or cast iron skillet. Push dough in the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Pinch off excess dough. You can save this dough to make another pizza or breadsticks. We usually stick it in the freezer for later.5. Evenly spread 1/2 cup BBQ sauce on the bottom of the pizza dough. Top sauce with 2 cups of the shredded mozzarella cheese. Roll the pizza dough that is on the side of the pan down, about one inch, and pinch to form a thick crust. Add the BBQ chicken, bacon, pineapple, and jalapeño slices. Sprinkle pizza toppings with the additional 1/4 cup of cheese.6. Place pizza in the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until crust is golden brown. Remove pizza from oven and let sit for 10 minutes.

another paper towel). Microwave on high 7 minutes. Bacon should be nice and crispy. Allow to cool to touch, then crumble and set aside.Preheat oven to 375°. Spray 4 oven-safe ramekins with non-stick cooking spray. Lay the croissants out on a floured surface (do not separate into triangles). Pinch all the seams together. Lightly dust the top with more flour. Roll into a large square (the rolling will help seal the seems). Using a pizza wheel (or sharp knife) cut into 4 equal size squares. Carefully lay one square into each of the ramekins, using your fingers to press them into the base (the egdes of the square with fall out of the ramekin). Set aside.In a microwave safe dish (I like to use my 4 cup pyrex glass measuring cup), Beat 4 of the eggs with the half and half, salt and pepper. Whisk in 1/2 cup of the swiss cheese, the onion, bacon crumbles, and parmesan cheese. Microwave on high in 30 second increments (stirring in bewteen) until a very runny scrambled egg consistency. It took me about 3 1/2-4 times (older microwaves may take longer... just look for the consistency). Place an equal amount of the egg mixture into each of the ramekins and top with a tablespoon or so of the swiss cheese. Fold the edges of the croissant over on top of the egg mixture (it won't cover the whole thing, you just want the croissants IN the ramekin, not OUT). Beat remaining egg and brush the tops of the croissant and souffle with it. I find it easier to just pour a little in each one and then use a pastry brush to spread it around. Place ramekins onto a baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes until golden and puffy. Serve hot. You may remove them from the ramekins or serve them in them.

boiling salted water, cook the pasta until al dente; drain. Set an extra-large skillet, or a large heavy saucepan, over medium-low heat and cook the bacon until crispy and the fat renders out, 10 to 12 minutes. Set the bacon aside, reserving the fat to build your sauce. At this point you should have about 1/4 cup of reserved fat. If needed, add some olive oil or butter to make sure you have a 1/4 cup of fat in the pan.                          Add the flour and cook, whisking constantly, until the paste bubbles a bit, about 2 minutes (make sure it doesn't brown). Continuing to whisk, add 3 cups of the hot milk and cook until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce the heat to low and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes. Stir in the dry mustard, and then gradually add the Cheddar and Muenster cheeses, stirring constantly until all of the cheese has melted into the sauce. Stir in the hot sauce and the remaining 1 cup milk. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and stir to coat. Stir in the crispy bacon and season with salt and pepper. You'll need 2 cups of mac and cheese for the sandwiches.                          For the grilled cheese: Top all 8 slices of bread with a slice of American cheese. This will act as your glue. Spoon 1/2 cup of the mac and cheese onto four of the slices, sprinkle with some basil, and then add a dollop of the spicy peppers. Top with 1 or 2 tomato slices, and cover with a second slice of bread.                          In a large nonstick skillet set over medium heat, spread 1/3 cup of the grated Parmesan in an even circle roughly the same size as your bread. Let the Parmesan begin to melt and brown, 2 to 3 minutes. As soon as it gets golden brown, set a sandwich on top of the Parmesan. Cook for 2 minutes more. The Parmesan will adhere to the bread and create a nice crispy crust. Remove the sandwich from the skillet and repeat the same process for the other side of the sandwich. Depending on the size of your pan, you may be able to do two sandwiches at a time. If needed, keep finished sandwiches warm in a 200 degree F oven while the others are cooking.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the mac and cheese: In a pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta until al dente; drain.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Put the chopped peaches, shallots, and jalapeños in the bowl of a food processor.

To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Talbott Sleepy Hollow Chardonnay () with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Sleepy Hollow consistently produces Chardonnay with intense tropical fruit character, which exhibits both richness and finesse. Sleepy Hollow Chardonnay is considered by many as one of the quality standards for California Chardonnay. Vineyard Manager and Winemaker Sam Balderas keeps yields low to increase concentration and minimizes the handling of the wine to preserve the fruit's natural essence. This wine is 100% barrel fermented in French Oak and aged on the yeast lees to impart a rich, toasty, complex character to the wine. \n\nTasting Notes for this Vintage\nConcentrated rich flavors of tropical fruit marry with mineral elements and French oak accents. A typically high level of acid produces a long, clean finish. Our signature Chardonnay, this wine can be cellared up to nine years and improves with age.
