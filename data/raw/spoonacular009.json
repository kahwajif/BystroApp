Unfold the puff pastry onto a cutting board. Using a 5-inch cookie cutter (or an overturned bowl and a small, sharp knife), cut four 5-inch circles from the dough. Place the rounds on a parchment-lined cookie sheet. Press a 3 1/2-inch cookie cutter into the center of each round, stopping 3/4 of the way down so that the outer and inner portions are still attached at the bottom. This will allow the outer ring to rise around the center.

Microwave for 20 seconds or until soft but not melted. Stir to combine well, then divide and spread over the inner section of each round. Top with overlapping apple slices, making sure to stay within the inner section of each round.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Combine the butter and honey in a small bowl and microwave for 30 seconds, or until the butter is almost melted. Stir to combine and complete the melting. (Be careful, as the honey gets hot surprisingly quickly.) Brush some honey butter over the entirety of each round. Dust lightly with ground allspice. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the apples are tender and the pastry is nicely browned.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Let the pastries cool slightly, then drizzle with additional honey if desired.

In food processor bowl fitted with steel blade, pulse flour, salt, and sugar to combine. Scatter butter pieces over flour mixture; cut butter into flour with five 1-second pulses. Add shortening and continue cutting in until flour is pale yellow and resembles coarse cornmeal, with butter bits no larger than small peas, about four more 1-second pulses. Turn mixture into medium bowl.2. Sprinkle 4 tablespoons ice water over mixture. With rubber spatula, use folding motion to evenly distribute water into flour mixture until small portion of dough holds together when squeezed in palm of hand; add up to 1 tablespoon more ice water if necessary. Turn dough onto clean, dry work surface; gather and gently press together into cohesive ball, then flatten into rough 4-inch disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 days, before rolling.3. Remove dough from refrigerator (if refrigerated longer than 30 minutes, let stand at room temperature until malleable). Roll dough on lightly floured work surface or between two large sheets of plastic wrap to 12-inch disk about 1/8 inch thick. Fold dough in quarters, then place dough point in center of 9-inch pie plate; unfold dough.4. Working around circumference of pan, ease dough carefully into pan corners by gently lifting dough edges with one hand while pressing around pan bottom with other hand. Trim edge to ½ inch beyond pan lip. Tuck rim of dough underneath itself so that folded edges are about ¼ inch beyond pan lip; flute dough. Refrigerate pie shell for 40 minutes, then freeze for 20 minutes. (This two-step process helps to reduce shrinkage of the crust during baking.)5. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Press doubled 18-inch square of heavy-duty foil inside shell and fold back edges of foil to shield fluted edge; evenly distribute about 2 cups metal or ceramic pie weights over foil. Bake, leaving foil and weights in place until dough dries and lightens in color, 17 to 20 minutes. Carefully remove foil and weights by gathering sides of foil and pulling up and out. Bake until light golden brown, about 9 minutes longer. Remove from oven; reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.6. Prick sweet potatoes several times with fork and place on double layer of paper towels in microwave (see illustrations below). Cook at full power for 5 minutes; turn each potato over and continue to cook at full power until tender, but not mushy, about 5 minutes longer. Cool 10 minutes. Halve each potato crosswise; insert small spoon between skin and flesh, and scoop flesh into medium bowl; discard skin. (If potatoes are too hot to handle comfortably, fold double layer of paper towels into quarters and use to hold potato half). Repeat with remaining sweet potatoes; you should have about 2 cups. While potatoes are still hot, add butter and mash with fork or wooden spoon; small lumps of potato should remain.7. Whisk together eggs, yolks, sugar, nutmeg, and salt in medium bowl; stir in bourbon, molasses, and vanilla, then whisk in milk. Gradually add egg mixture to sweet potatoes, whisking gently to combine.8. Heat partially baked pie shell in oven until warm, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle bottom of pie shell evenly with brown sugar. Pour sweet potato mixture into pie shell over brown sugar layer. Bake until filling is set around edges but center jiggles slightly when shaken, about 45 minutes. (Check about halfway through - if the crust is browning too much, cover with foil.) Transfer pie to wire rack; cool to room temperature, about 2 hours, and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In food processor bowl fitted with steel blade, pulse flour, salt, and sugar to combine.

To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The NV Mindbender Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428583,"title":"NV Mindbender Chardonnay","description":"Lightly Oaked, the Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal.

Wrap exterior of a 9-inch springform pan (including base) in a double layer of foil; set aside.Make the crust: Stir together chocolate wafer crumbs, melted butter, and 2 tablespoons sugar in a medium bowl. Press crumb mixture firmly onto bottom of prepared foil-wrapped pan. Bake in the heated oven until set, about 10 minutes. Let springform pan cool on a wire rack. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F.Make the ganache: Heat the cream in a small saucepan set over medium-high heat until bubbles begin to vigorously form at the edge of the pan. Remove from heat; add chocolate (do not stir). Let stand 5 minutes, then stir until smooth, returning it to very low heat if necessary. Pour chocolate ganache evenly over the bottom of the cooled crust. Chill ½ hour and up to overnight before continuing.Make the cherry puree: Meanwhile puree the cherries in a food processor or blender until very smooth. Press puree through a fine mesh sieve into a small saucepan; discard solids. Stir in 2 tablespoons sugar and lemon juice. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring often. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.Make the filling: Put cream cheese in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; blend on medium speed until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Lower the speed and add remaining 1 ½ cups sugar in a slow, steady stream. Add salt and vanilla; mix until well combined. Using a rubber spatula, mix in the eggs one at a time until well combined (but do not over mix). Carefully dollop the cream cheese filling over crust, making sure not to disturb the chocolate ganache layer. Smooth the top carefully. Drop cherry sauce by the teaspoon in various spots evenly around the top. With a wooden skewer or toothpick, swirl sauce into filling, making an attractive pattern on top. Take care not to push the wooden skewer or toothpick deeply enough into the cherry and cream cheese to disturb the chocolate ganache bottom. Experiment, making a pretty pattern. Don’t worry if you don’t use all the sauce, there is no right or wrong way.Set filled springform pan inside a large, shallow roasting pan. Transfer to oven. Carefully add hot water into roasting pan to reach halfway up sides. Bake until cake is set but still slightly wobbly in center, 60 to 70 minutes.Transfer cake pan to wire rack; let cake cool completely. Refrigerate, from 6 hours to overnight. Before unmolding, run a warm, wet knife blade around edge of cake. Slice into wedges for serving, wiping the knife clean with warm water after every slice of the knife. Serve immediately.Share this:ShareGoogleTwitterPinterestFacebookLike this:Like Loading...","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Reviewers quite like it with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":439055,"title":"Castello di Volpaia Chianti Classico Riserva","description":"Color: Ruby red with a trace of garnet Nose: Elegant and intense with hints of spices connected with fruity scents Taste: Good structure with evident tannins and long persistence","price":"$23.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/439055-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.82,"ratingCount":8,"score":0.7799999999999999,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fcastello-di-volpaia-chianti-classico-riserva-2003%2F92756"}]},"instructions":"Place the instant coffee in the hot water and stir.

Add up to the entire amount of coffee, depending on how strong you want your tiramisu. (I added all of it because thats how I roll.) Mix in vanilla.Fold whipped cream into coffee mixture gently. Place the tiramisu in a gallon size ziploc bag that is fitted with a large round or 1M tip.Pipe a small amount the bottom of each of 4 serving glasses (my glasses were 6 ounce size). Top the layer with a dusting of cocoa powder. Continue layering the tiramisu and cocoa powder. Once you get to the top layer, grate the 1 ounce of semi-sweet baking chocolate over the tops of the serving dishes (instead of the dusting of cocoa powder).

                              For the Cake: Combine gelatin, cardamom, and 1/4 cup water in small bowl and allow to soften, about 5 minutes. Microwave 45 seconds and allow to cool to room temperature, 5 to 7 minutes.                                                                                                                                2                                                                            Meanwhile, pulse 1 cup diced mango, 1/4 cup sugar, and lime juice in food processor until completely puréed.

Increase heat to medium-high and boil syrup until it registers 238°F on candy thermometer, about 5 minutes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            While syrup boils, with electric mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip egg whites, vanilla bean seeds, and salt with whisk attachment on medium speed until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            When syrup reaches temperature, with mixer running on medium-high speed, slowly and carefully pour into egg whites. Beat until outside of bowl is cool to the touch and whites are thick and glossy, about 7 minutes. Add gelatin mixture and beat just to combine.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Whisk mascarpone, sweetened condensed milk, and pureed mango mixture together in large bowl. Mix in 1/3 of meringue. With rubber spatula, fold in remaining meringue. Fold in remaining 2 cups mango.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            To Assemble: Line bottom of 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper round. Reserve 24 of the best looking ladyfingers and, with serrated knife, gently cut each into 3 1/4 inches long.  Break remaining 20 cookies into 1/2-inch pieces.                                                                                                                            8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Cover bottom of pan with half of the cookie pieces. Scrape half the mango mixture (about 4 1/2 cups) into pan over cookies. With rubber spatula, spread out over cookies, leaving a 1-inch gap between mixture and edge of pan. Tuck the 24 whole ladyfingers into the gap vertically; this will help keep them standing up straight. Once finished, spread the mango filling all the way to touch the cookies.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Top filling with remaining half of cookie pieces, pressing gently in with fingertips.

Transfer to small bowl and set aside.Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pot, along with the chopped garlic and onions. Sauté over medium-low heat for 4-5 minutes until onions soften and start to get transparent. (Don't let them brown)Add broth, water, potatoes and salt to the pot. Bring to a boil. Lower heat to a steady simmer and cook for 15 minutes, until the potatoes are tender. Using a potato masher, mash half the potatoes right in the pot, so you have a creamy broth with some chunks of potato remaining.Add the cooked chopped sausage and the slivered kale. Cook for 3-4 minutes, until the kale wilts and the soup is heated through.Ladle soup into bowls and top each with a few rounds of cooked sausage. Enjoy!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium heat.
