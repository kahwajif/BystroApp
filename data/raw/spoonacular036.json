Sprinkle chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper and salt and pepper on top. Use your hands to toss the veggies to evenly distribute the spices and oil. Dump veggies onto a large baking sheet and evenly spread out to the edges. Roast in the oven for 20 minutes. Once done roasting, reduce oven heat to 350 degrees F.While the veggies are roasting, prepare the enchilada sauce: In a large saucepan or skillet, heat olive oil over medium high heat. Add in onions and cook, stirring frequently until they become translucent, about 5 mins. Add in garlic, chili powder, cumin, and oregano and cook for 30 more seconds. Add in tomato sauce and water; stir well to combine. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer sauce for 20 minutes or until thickened up a bit. Add salt and pepper to taste.Spray a 2 quart circular dish, cake pan or spring foam pan with nonstick cooking spray. Add 1/2 cup enchilada sauce to the bottom of the pan and add a tortilla, spread about 1/2 cup of refried beans on the tortilla then top 1/4 of the roasted veggies, add 1/2 cup of enchilada sauce then sprinkle 1/3 cup of cheese on top. Repeat 3 more layers, then pour remaining enchilada sauce on top with remaining cheese.Bake in the oven for 20-30 minutes or until cheese is melted and a little golden around the edges.

the sausages, mix together the pork, breadcrumbs, egg, garlic and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Fry a tiny bit of the mixture in a pan with a little olive or sunflower oil to see if the seasoning is good.Divide the mixture into 12 portions and shape each one into a sausage. Place on a baking sheet or plate and set aside until you want to cook them. (Chilling them for a day in the fridge is fine, or you can freeze them.)For the colcannon and cabbage:To make the colcannon, cook the potatoes, covered, in boiling salted water for 10 minutes. Then drain 3/4 of the water and continue to cook over low heat with the lid on for another 20 to 30 minutes until cooked. Test using a skewer or feel with your fingers; avoid stabbing the potatoes with a knife because this will make them break up. When cooked, drain all the remaining water, peel and mash with 1/4 cup of the butter while hot. I usually hold the potato on a fork and peel with a knife if they are hot.Meanwhile, cook the cabbage. Cut the cabbage into quarters, then cut out the core. Thinly slice the cabbage across the grain. Heat a saucepan, add the remaining 1/4 cup butter, water and the sliced cabbage. Toss over medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes, until just cooked. Add to the potatoes, then add most of the hot milk and the parsley, keeping some of the milk back in case you do not need it all.Season to taste and beat until creamy and smooth, adding more milk if necessary.For the applesauce and cooking:While the potatoes are cooking, make the applesauce and sausage. To make the applesauce, put the apple in a small saucepan with the water. Cover and cook over a gentle heat (stir every now and then) until the apple has broken down to a mush. Add sugar to taste.To cook the sausages, heat a frying pan on a low to medium heat, add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and gently fry the sausages for 12 to 15 minutes, until golden on all sides and cooked on the inside.

The wine's soft tannins, lingering finish, and rich, complex taste make this a delightful accompaniment to roast chicken, pork, or beef.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/433037-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.82,"ratingCount":9,"score":0.7842857142857143,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fclos-du-val-merlot-2002%2F83430"}]},"instructions":"Procedures                                                                              1                                                                            To make the marinade, mix together the garlic, red miso, mirin, sake, tobanjan, and sugar in a bowl.

about 1/4 inch of the stem end to expose the cloves. Add the lentils to a large pot and cover them by 2 inches with water. Add the onion, carrots, celery, bay leaf, the head of garlic and a couple of pinches of salt. Bring the lentils to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the lentils are creamy and tender, about 40 minutes.                          Remove and discard the onion, carrots, celery, bay leaf and garlic. Using an immersion blender, puree about one-third of the lentils and return them to the pot. (Or scoop one-third of the lentils into a standard blender and puree, then add back to the pot.)                          For the soffrito: In a food processor, combine the red onion, carrots, celery, rosemary and thyme and pulse until the vegetables are minced. Add the mixture to a separate large soup pot along with the olive oil. Turn the heat to high and fry the vegetables, stirring occasionally, until they soften and color slightly, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the tomato paste, canned tomatoes with their juice, and a couple pinches of salt to the soffrito and stir. Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 10 minutes. Add the kale and another pinch of salt, stirring to coat the leaves. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10 minutes, until the kale is soft.                          Add the lentils into the pot of vegetables and stir. Add about 2 cups water, a little at a time, to thin the soup (it can be more or less water, depending on the level of thickness you prefer). Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to come together. Taste and add salt, if needed. Serve with black pepper, Parmesan and a drizzle of olive oil.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"For the lentils","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Remove the outer layers from the head of garlic and cut off about 1/4 inch of the stem end to expose the cloves.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the lentils to a large pot and cover them by 2 inches with water.","ingredients":[{"id":16069,"name":"lentils","image":"lentils-brown.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the onion, carrots, celery, bay leaf, the head of garlic and a couple of pinches of salt.

Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8073684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Ffonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998%2F12434"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                Cook rice according to package directions.

onion, if using (I typically leave the onion out). Set aside.In a small to medium size bowl combine the oregano, thyme, basil, creole seasoning, chili powder, cayenne pepper, pepper and salt. Set aside.Before you begin the next step, make sure you have completed steps 1 and 2. It is very important to have all your ingredients prepped and ready go.Grab a seat. No literally, grab a sit. You cannot walk away from the roux over the next 20-30 minutes. Heat a large heavy bottom soup pot over medium-low heat. Add the canola oil and flour to the pot and whisk to combine. Stir the roux EVERY 15-25 SECONDS. You will be able to smell the flour starting to brown. Continue to gently brown flour without burning it until the mixture turns the color of peanut butter or a dark caramel. This can take 30 minutes or so but it is the heart of the recipe. If you burn it, start over. This time just keep stirring and keep an eye on it! It took me 25 minutes to achieve a dark peanut butter color.Once you have your roux made, add all your vegetables (everything in the bowl). The roux will bubble and thicken up immediately into a paste which coats the vegetables. Let the veggies cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring every couple minutes or so. Sprinkle spice mixture over the vegetables, stir and cook 3-5 minutes longer.Add chicken broth, canned tomatoes, chicken thighs and sausage to the pot. Bring the gumbo to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered for at least 3 hours or up to all day (the longer the better for flavors to blend). The gumbo should be the consistency of stew. If too much of the liquid evaporates add water to thin and if there is too much liquid leave the top off the soup and cook 30 minutes longer. Once the meat has cooked through, skim fat from top and lightly shred the chicken. Serve over rice and sprinkle with file powder (sassafras powder) if you have it.

You will need at least 2 inches of oil in the pot.). Preheat the oil to 340F (170C). Using paper towel, pat dry the vegetables before you add them into the oil. Deep fry until theyre tender. Be careful not to over/under cook. When theyre done, drain the oil on a wire rack or paper towel.Next, coat the chicken in potato starch and deep fry at 340F (170C) for 5 minutes or until golden brown.

Pulse the graham crackers in a food processor until crumbled. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons water and the butter; pulse until moistened. Wrap the outside of a 9-inch springform pan with foil to prevent leaks. Coat the inside of the pan with cooking spray and press the crumbs onto the bottom. Bake until browned, about 8 minutes. Let cool, about 10 minutes.                          Meanwhile, beat both cream cheeses and the sugar with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth, 5 minutes, then beat in the sour cream on low. Lightly whisk the 3 egg whites in a bowl, then add to the cheese mixture along with the 2 whole eggs, flour, vanilla and lemon zest. Beat on medium speed until fluffy, 3 minutes.

d'oeuvre"],"diets":["dairy free"],"occasions":["easter"],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"To start, fill two large, rimmed baking sheets (11X17-inch) with flour, shaking to get a mostly even layer. Using a plastic Easter egg (you can also use a real egg or other egg-shape object for the mold), press lightly into the flour to make egg molds. Space the indentations about 1-2 inches apart. If the next indentation messes up the sides of the first indentation, don't stress. Simply press the egg shape lightly into each indentation that needs the edges fixed a bit. Using a 2-inch (in length) plastic egg, I make about 6 indentations across in 3 rows for a total of 18 indentations for each sheet pan. Set the sheet pans carefully aside.For the marshmallows, pour the cold water into the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (you can do this without a stand mixer, but you'll need to use an electric handheld mixer that won't burn out after 10 or so minutes of mixing) and sprinkle the gelatin over the top, letting it soften.While the gelatin softens, combine the sugar, corn syrup, water, and salt in a medium saucepan and heat over medium-low heat until the sugar dissolves. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan and increase the heat to medium. Let the mixture come to a boil and continue cooking without stirring until the syrup reaches 240 degrees F on the thermometer.Turn the mixer to low speed and (carefully!) pour the hot syrup into the mixer in a slow and steady stream. Once it has all been added, turn the mixer to medium or high and let the mixer whip the mixture for 10-13 minutes, until the mixture is cooled and is thick and fluffy. You don't want it to mix quite as much as when making marshmallows that will be poured into a pan to later be cut into squares. The mixture should be slightly softer than that so that it molds to the egg indentations made in the flour. Mix in the vanilla extract.Grease two spoons with cooking spray and carefully scoop spoonfuls of the marshmallow mixture into the indentations in the flour (see the pictures below, if needed). Once all the egg molds are filled with marshmallow, let them sit for 10-15 minutes. Once slightly set, gently lift an edge of the marshmallow and carefully flip over so it is now sticky-side down in the flour. Don't press on it or push it into the flour, just let it gently sit on the top of the flour. Let the marshmallows set for 1-2 hours (or up to overnight - covered loosely with plastic wrap). Take each marshmallow egg and rub it briskly with the palms of your hands to remove any excess flour. It's ok if there is still a very light coating of flour on the egg - it won't be noticeable after the egg is covered in chocolate. All the excess flour can be poured right back into the flour bag/container.Melt the chocolate over low heat or in the microwave on 50% power in 1-minute increments until melted and smooth. To prevent blooming (the white streaks in chocolate after it has set), stir in a bit of reserved finely chopped chocolate into the hot, melted chocolate to lower the temperature just a bit.One by one, drop a marshmallow egg into the chocolate. Using a fork, cover the egg in chocolate. Lift the egg up onto the fork and tap the handle of the fork on the edge of the bowl to let the excess chocolate fall through the tines of the fork into the bowl. Gently scrape the bottom of the fork on the edge of the bowl and then transfer the egg to a parchment or wax paper lined baking sheet, using the edge of a butter knife to help slide the egg off the fork onto the parchment. Repeat with the remaining eggs. If using sprinkles, toss them lightly on the eggs while still wet with chocolate. Place the eggs in the refrigerator to let the chocolate set. After the chocolate has set, colored melting wafers or other chocolate can be drizzled over the eggs. Store in the refrigerator for up to a week.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To start, fill two large, rimmed baking sheets (11X17-inch) with flour, shaking to get a mostly even layer.

boil until cooked.                          While the potatoes are cooking, preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. Cut each chicken thigh into 3 strips and place in a bowl. Rub the meat all over with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper, then toss.                          Heat a large frying pan, big enough to hold all the chicken pieces snugly in 1 layer, and put the chicken into the pan, skin side down. If you don't have a pan that's big enough, feel free to cook the chicken in 2 batches. Toss and fry over a high heat for 10 minutes or so, until almost cooked, then remove with a slotted spoon to an ovenproof pan or dish.                          Prick the tomatoes with a sharp knife. Place them in a bowl, cover with boiling water and leave for a minute or so. Drain and, when cool enough to handle, pinch off their skins. You don't have to, but by doing this they will become lovely and sweet when cooked, and their intense flavor will infuse the potatoes. By now the potatoes will be cooked. Drain them in a colander and lightly crush them by pushing down on them with your thumb.                          Bash up most of the oregano leaves with a pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar, or a Flavor Shaker if you have one. Add 4 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil, a good splash of red wine vinegar and some pepper and give everything another bash. Add to the chicken with the potatoes, the tomatoes and the rest of the oregano leaves. Toss everything together carefully. Spread out in a single layer in an appropriately sized roasting pan, and bake for 40 minutes in the preheated oven until golden.                          Lovely served with an arugula salad dressed with some lemon juice and extra-virgin olive oil, and a nice glass of white wine.                          \"Our agreement with the producers of \"Jamie at Home\" only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

the menu? Try pairing with Pinot Noir, Riesling, and Sparkling rosé. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too.

The actual blend is 64% John Sebastiano Vineyard Pinot Noir, 22% Clos Pepe, 9% Lindley, and 6% Cargasacchi. Clonally, this wine is a blend of 8 different clones which also provides for a wide range of flavors within one wine. The 2014 Pinot Noir Sta.
