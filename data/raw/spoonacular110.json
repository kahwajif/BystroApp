vegetarian"],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"1. Prepare the Biga: Combine the bread flour, water and yeast in a large bowl and stir with a wooden spoon until a uniform mass forms and no dry flour remains, about 1 minute. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature overnight (at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours).2. Prepare the Soaker: Combine the whole-wheat flour, wheat germ and milk in a large bowl and stir with wooden spoon until a shaggy mass forms, about 1 minute. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Return soaker to the bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight (at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours).3. Prepare the Dough: Tear the soaker into 1-inch pieces and place in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add the biga, honey, salt, yeast, butter and oil. Mix on low speed until a cohesive mass starts to form, about 2 minutes. Increase speed to medium and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn out dough onto lightly floured counter and knead for 1 minute. The dough will be very soft and slack. Transfer the dough to a large clean, lightly greased bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise at room temperature for 45 minutes.4. Lightly flour your fingertips. Gently press down on center of dough to deflate. Holding the edge of the dough with your fingertips, fold the dough over itself by gently lifting and folding edge of dough toward the middle. Turn the bowl 90 degrees and fold again. Turn the bowl and fold the dough 6 more times (for a total of 8 folds). Cover and allow to rise at room temperature until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.5. Adjust the oven racks to middle and lowest positions, place a baking stone on the middle rack, and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray two 9x5-inch loaf pans with non-stick cooking spray. Transfer the dough to a well-floured work surface and divide into 2 equal pieces. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, pat each into an 8x17-inch rectangle. With the short side facing you, roll the dough toward you into firm cylinder, keeping the roll taut by tucking it under itself as you go. Turn the loaf seam side up and pinch it closed. Place the loaf seam side down in the prepared loaf pan, pressing it gently into the corners. Repeat with the second piece of dough. Cover the loaves loosely with plastic wrap and allow to rise at room temperature until almost doubled in size, 60 to 90 minutes (the top of the loaves should rise about 1 inch above the edge of the pan).6. Place an empty baking pan (not glass!) on the bottom oven rack and bring 2 cups of water to boil on the stove. Using a sharp serrated knife or single-edge razor blade, make one ¼-inch-deep slash lengthwise down the center of each loaf. Pour the boiling water into the empty loaf pan on the bottom rack and place the loaves on the baking stone. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees (177 degrees C). Bake until the crust is dark brown and the internal temperature registers 200 degrees F (93 degrees C) on an instant-read thermometer, 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the loaves 180 degrees and side to side halfway through baking.7. Transfer the pans to a wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Remove the loaves from the pans, return to the wire rack, and cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. The bread should be double-wrapped in plastic wrapped and stored at room temperature for up to 3 days. The loaf can be wrapped with an additional layer of aluminum foil and frozen for up to 1 month.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Prepare the Biga","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine the bread flour, water and yeast in a large bowl and stir with a wooden spoon until a uniform mass forms and no dry flour remains, about 1 minute.

You could also use 9\" pans or 9\" springform pans.If using round cake pans, cut a piece of wax paper to fit the bottom of the pan. Spray the pan with non-stick spray, then place the piece of wax paper in the bottom, wax-side up. Spray the top of the wax paper with non-stick spray.If using a springform pans, open the pan and place a piece of wax paper large enough to cover the bottom in the pan. Close the sides of the pan, and cut around the outside of the pan so the edges of the paper aren't hanging out. Wrap a piece of tin foil around the outside to catch any leaks. Spray the inside of the pan with non-stick spray.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and prepare pans.In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder and baking soda and salt until combined.Add eggs, buttermilk, oil and vanilla and whisk until combined. Slowly whisk in coffee (batter will be thin).Divide evenly between two pans. Bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean or with moist crumbs.Set aside to cool. Then wrap in plastic wrap and place in the freezer.Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and prepare pans (the same pans or the same size you used for the cake).In the bowl of a stand mixer, add cream cheese, sugar and vanilla. Beat on medium-high until smooth.Add eggs, sour cream/yogurt, and raspberry puree. Beat on medium speed until combined, scraping down the bowl half way.Stir in oreos.Divide evenly between 2 pans. Bake at 325 degrees F for 40-50 minutes, until cheesecake is mostly set and just starting to brown at the edges. Remove from the oven and let rest until it reaches room temperature. Refrigerate at least a couple hours before removing from the pan, wrapping in plastic wrap and placing in the freezer.In a small bowl, combine chocolate, cream and coffee. Microwave on high 1 minute. Stir until smooth, placing back in the microwave for 20-30 seconds if necessary.Cool in the fridge for 10-20 minutes, stirring once.In a stand mixer, beat butter, chocolate mixture and icing sugar: first on low speed for 2-3 minutes until combined, then increase the speed to medium or medium-high and beat until fluffy and the colour lightens substantially, another 3-4 minutes.I recommend not refrigerating before frosting, as this frosting sets up nice and firm once refrigerated.Prepare the ganache only after the cake has been assembled and frosted. In a microwave safe bowl (or glass measuring cup), combine chocolate and coffee. Microwave for 45 seconds to 1 minute on high. Stir until smooth, microwaving another 20-30 seconds if necessary.Let cool to room temperature before topping the cake.I like to work with my cakes frozen because it's easier they're not as crumbly and they carve easily. This also means I can make the cake over several days.Start with an 8\" cardboard cake board on your cake tray. This is optional, but it makes it easier to move your cake from a carrier to your cake plate without making a mess of it.Place one chocolate cake layer down and cover with a thin layer of frosting. Top with a cheesecake layer, and cover with a thin layer of frosting. *If your cakes are really uneven, you may want to trim the tops off slightly so they lay a little flatter.Repeat layers one more time, so all 4 layers are used. Adjust cake layers slightly so they line up as evenly as possible (photo 2). If your edges are uneven and you want a nice straight cake, trim the sides with a long serrated knife (photo 3).Cover cake with a thin layer of frosting to seal in the crumbs (photo 4). Refrigerate cake for 1 hour, but leave the frosting on the counter.Cover cake with remaining frosting, making sure to cover cake completely.

Remove one-third of the brownie balls from the refrigerator and insert the lollipop sticks. Dip the brownie balls into the melted almond bark coating. Swirl or tap off any excess. Press the coated brownie balls into your preferred decorations. I recommend using ramekins to hold each of the different decorations. At this point, you could also enlist the help of your birthday boy or girl to help with the decorating [yes, it's that easy].Place the coated brownie pops onto parchment paper and let stand until the coating is set.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Oil 2 8-inch round cake pans.  Line the bottom only with parchment.In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  I did this by hand, but a hand or stand mixer would work as well.  Mix in the egg whites one at a time.  Mix in the vanilla and oil.In a medium bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, and salt.  Add this to the sugar mixture, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with the flour.  I did 3 additions of flour and 2 of milk.  Mix until fully incorporated.  Stir in the sprinkles until distributed.Divide the batter evenly among the pans.  Smooth the tops and sprinkle with the remaining tablespoon of sprinkles.  Bake for about 25 minutes until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs.  Cool cakes completely in pan.Make the frosting.  In a medium saucepan, combine sugar, water, and corn syrup over medium heat, stirring frequently until the sugar is completely dissolved. Once this happens, stop stirring, attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan, and allow the mixture to come to 240 degrees F on the thermometer. In the meantime, place the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on medium-high until foamy. Once foamy, add the cream of tartar and continue beating on medium-high until stiff peaks form. Be sure not to over whip the egg whites or they will become dry.Once the eggs are whipped and the syrup is at 240, turn the eggs to medium-low, immediately remove the syrup from the heat, and begin slowly and steadily drizzling it into the eggs. If the syrup is ready before the eggs, it can be turned down or removed from the heat while the eggs finish, before being replaced on the heat to bring to temperature. If the eggs are ready before the syrup, stop mixing them until the syrup is almost ready. Turn them back to medium-high briefly before turning them back down and adding the syrup.Once the syrup has all been added, turn the mixer back to medium-high and beat the frosting (what is basically marshmallow crme and is delectable all by itself) for 10-13 minutes until the bottom of the bowl is barely warm or at room temperature. It is important for it to not be too warm or the next step will not work.Once cooled, add the butter a couple tablespoons at a time, allowing each addition to incorporate before adding another. Scrape down the bowl occasionally. Once all the butter is incorporated, add the vanilla bean paste and mix to combine. Remove the bowl from the mixer and mix briefly by hand to make sure there are no clumps of butter. If the frosting is a bit soupy (because it was too warm when the butter was added) stick it in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes, beat it again with the stand mixer. It should come together.Carefully remove 1 cake from the pan and place it on a cake stand.  Cover it with a generous amount of frosting.  Place the other cake on top.  Frost the top and sides of the cake completely.  Carefully press Fruity Pebbles onto the sides of the cake.Cake may be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 3 days, or frozen in pieces, wrapped in plastic and foil and placed in a zipper bag for up to 3 months.  Thaw at room temperature for about 1 hour.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the cake.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Oil 2 8-inch round cake pans.

Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti.

Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses.

Combine the popcorn kernels and vegetable oil in a medium pot. Cover with a lid and cook over medium heat until the kernels begin to pop. Vigorously shake the pot to prevent the popcorn from burning. Continue to cook until you no longer hear the kernels popping, about 5 minutes. Spread the popcorn on a sheet pan to cool. Discard any unpopped kernels.Combine the granulated sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup and water in another medium pot and bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook without stirring until the caramel reaches 235F (115C) and turns a color similar to honey.Add the butter to the pot and slowly swirl to mix. Cook until the caramel reaches 300% (149C) and is about 2 shades darker and the bubbles are much smaller.Add the baking soda and salt. Be careful! The baking soda might cause the caramel to splatter. Whisk until completely incorporated.Using a heatproof spatula, fold the popcorn into the caramel until it is well coated. Pour the popcorn back onto the sheet pan. Separate the popcorn clusters immediately with the spatula.When cooled, about 10 minutes, use a chef's knife to finely chop the popcorn. Store in an airtight container until needed.Make Pate a choux and chouquettesPlace a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375F (190C) or 350F (175C) for convection.Combine the water, milk, butter, sugar and salt in a medium pot. Bring to a boil over medium heat.Add the flour and stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture comes together and forms a dough. Continue to stir the dough until it begins to dry and you see a film start to form at the bottom of the pot as the result of the dough sticking. 1 or 2 minutes.Transfer the dough to a stand mixer fitted with a paddle. If you don't have a mixer, use a heatproof spatula to mix the dough. Add the eggs one at a time and mix on low speed, making sure each egg is full incorporated before adding the next. This may seem difficult at first, but eventually the batter will loosen up.Cut the tip of a piping bag to snugly fit a #803 plain tip. using a rubber spatula, place 2 large scoops of choux dough in the bag so that it is one third full. Push the dough down toward the tip of the bag.Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Holding the piping bag at a 90 degree angle about  inch above the pan, pipe dots of choux dough about 1 inches in diameter, spacing it about 1 inch apart. Continue piping until all the choux dough has been used, refilling the piping bag as necessary.Using a pastry brush or the tips of your fingers, lightly brush the egg wash onto the choux. sprinkle the caramelized popcorn over the choux completely covering the surface. Do the same with the pearl sugar. Using your fingers, press thepopcorn and pearl sugar into the choux to ensure that they stick as the choux bake.Bake the choux on the center rack for 10 minutes. Rotate the pan 180 degrees and bake for 10 minutes more. When finished, the choux will be golden brown and feel light to the touch. When broken open, the choux should be mostly hollow.Let the choux sit on the parchment paper until cool. When cool, remove gently from the parchment with your fingers.NOTE: These did not puff up for me so I have decided to call them Popcorn Chouquette Cookies. I am sure it's some failure on my part as a French pastry chef but they are equally delicious this way.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make Caramelized Popcorn - Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404770,"name":"baking paper","image":"baking-paper.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Combine the popcorn kernels and vegetable oil in a medium pot.

Transfer the mixture to a piece of plastic wrap and shape into a log about 1½-inches in diameter. Smooth the plastic wrap tightly around the log, and reinforce with a piece of foil. Transfer to the freezer and chill until at least slightly firm, at least 2 hours. The mixture will still be somewhat soft but firmer.To make the muffins, preheat the oven to 350? F. Line muffin pans with paper liners. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, pumpkin pie spice, salt and baking soda; whisk to blend. In the bowl of an electric mixer combine the eggs, sugar, pumpkin puree and oil. Mix on medium-low speed until blended. With the mixer on low speed, add in the dry ingredients, mixing just until incorporated.To make the topping, combine the sugar, flour and cinnamon in a small bowl; whisk to blend.

I always get inpatient here and mix it together with my hands so that it looks like the texture of wet sand. I know you aren't supposed to do it this way but I'm impatient. Transfer to the refrigerator to chill until ready to use.To assemble the muffins, fill each muffin well with a small amount of batter, just enough to cover the bottom of the liner (1-2 tablespoons). Slice the log of cream cheese filling into 24 equal pieces. Place a slice of the cream cheese mixture into each muffin well. You want to put the cream cheese lower than you think because it will rise a lot during the baking process. Divide the remaining batter among the muffin cups, placing on top of the cream cheese to cover completely. Sprinkle a small amount of the topping mixture over each of the muffin wells.Bake for 20-25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely before serving. I like them warm, cold, and room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To prepare the filling, combine the cream cheese and powdered sugar in a medium bowl and mix well until blended and smooth.","ingredients":[{"id":19336,"name":"powdered sugar","image":"powdered-sugar.jpg"},{"id":1017,"name":"cream cheese","image":"cream-cheese.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Transfer the mixture to a piece of plastic wrap and shape into a log about 1½-inches in diameter.
