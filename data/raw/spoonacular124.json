When all the granulated sugar has been incorporated, continue to whip until stiff.Add the almond meal mixture to the meringue, and fold together, until the batter drops from the spatula in a long ribbon. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip, and pipe 1 1/2-inch diameter rounds onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Allow to dry for 45-60 minutes, or until thin, dry membrane forms on the surface.Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F, and bake the macarons (one sheet at a time) until set (approximately 10-15 minutes). Do not brown. Allow to cool on the baking sheet, then carefully peel from the parchment and sandwich with vanilla buttercream and strawberry macaron shells.To make the vanilla buttercream:Place the egg whites and sugar in a large mixing bowl set over a pot of simmering water. Cook, whisking occasionally, until the mixture is smooth, thin, and translucent, and it no longer feels gritty when rubbed between the thumb and forefinger. Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk on medium-high speed until fluffy and stiff, and no hint of warmth remains when you place your hand on the side of the bowl. Add the butter, a tablespoon at a time, whipping after each addition. If the mixturestarts to look curdled, continue to whip on high speed until it comes back together, before adding the remaining butter.

The nose is a sensual feast—cinnamon and cardamom; the zest of lemons and limes; candied ginger, cherries and crushed stones. Lush and almost thick on the palate, \"Crayeres\" shows notes of currants and strawberries, reminding of a still red wine.

Resift the sifted flour along with the baking powder, nutmeg, clove, cinnamon, and salt into a bowl. Now, resift the flour mixture and then set it aside.3. In another bowl, using an electric mixer on high speed, beat the butter until it’s soft and very pliant, about 1 minute (or 4 to 6 minutes by hand with a wooden spoon). Gradually add the granulated sugar and beat on high speed until the mixture is pale and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes (or 6 to 8 minutes by hand).4. One at time, add the 4 whole eggs and beat on high speed until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes (or 5 minutes by hand).5. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in 3 equal parts, beating on low speed or stirring with the wooden spoon until the batter is smooth and the flour is well combined with the butter mixture. Add the egg yolks and vanilla and continue to beat or stir until they’re well mixed into the batter.6. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the surface. Place on the middle oven rack and bake until a toothpick inserted into the thickest part of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour (though I’d recommend checking it after 45 minutes).7. Remove the pan from the oven and let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. If necessary, carefully run a thin knife around the perimeter and the inner rim of the cake to help loosen it from the pan. Invert the pan onto the rack and lift it off of the cake. Turn the cake right side up and let it cool on the rack.8. Transfer the cake to a serving platter. Using a fine-mesh sieve, dust the top with the powdered sugar, if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C).

Make the Filling: In a large saucepan, combine the milk and cream and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Immediately remove from the heat and set aside.                          Melt the butter in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the brown sugar, raise the heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring constantly, until caramelized, 5 to 7 minutes. (You'll smell a characteristic nutty caramel odor when the butter browns, signaling that the mixture is ready.)                          Whisking constantly, gradually add the butter/brown sugar mixture to the hot milk/cream mixture. If the mixture isn't smooth, blend for 20 seconds with a hand blender or pour through a fine sieve.                          Put the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Whisk in about 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture. Whisk in the cornstarch and salt until dissolved. Whisk the cornstarch mixture back into the hot milk mixture in the saucepan. Whisk in the Scotch.                          While whisking constantly, cook over medium-high heat until thick and just boiling. When the mixture thickens, the whisk will leave trail marks on the bottom of the pot and the mixture will have a few large bubbles boiling up to the top.                          Turn off the heat and whisk in the vanilla extract. Pour into the prebaked pie shell and set aside while you make the meringue.                          Make the Meringue: In a standing mixer fitted with a whip attachment, whip the whites in a clean dry bowl on low speed until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and continue whipping on medium speed until soft peaks are formed. Gradually pour in the sugar and continue whipping on high speed until stiff and glossy. Pile the meringue onto the pie and swirl to cover, spreading it to the edge. (Making sure it touches the edge.) Bake the pie until the meringue is lightly browned, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Cover lightly with plastic wrap and set aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Line baking sheets with parchment or use a silpat.

together sugar, cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.Add butter and mix on medium-low speed for three minutes.

The batter will be liquid. (Don't worry, you didn't do anything wrong. It's supposed to be that way.)Divide batter evenly between 12 baking cups.  They should be about 1/3 full.Preheat oven to 350 F.In a medium-sized saucepan, whisk together sugar, cornstarch, flour, and salt.Slowly add water, stirring until well mixed.Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly, and cook for 3 minutes.Remove from heat and slowly pour half of the hot mixture into the egg yolks, stirring constantly.  If you pour too much too quickly you can accidentally cook the eggs - bad news. Stirring constantly, pour the eggs back into the pot, return to a boil, and cook for another 2 minutes.Add the zest, lemon juice, and butter.  Cook for another 2 minutes, stirring to ensure that nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan.Divide filling evenly between the baking cups on top of the cupcake batter.  After adding the lemon filling, the cups should be just over halfway filled.Bake for 18 minutes or until the cupcakes bounce back when lightly touched.  They may have divots from the weight of the lemon filling and that's OK.  You will be covering the surfaces up.Set a metal mixing bowl (I suggest using the one from your stand-mixer if you own one) over a pot of boiling water and fill with egg whites, sugar, and salt.  Stir the mixture constantly for about 3 minutes or until the sugar is dissolved and the eggs reach 110 F.  If you don't have a candy thermometer, don't sweat the exact temperature.  The whole point is to heat the eggs a little so that they are safe to eat.Place the bowl on a stand mixer with the whisk attachment or use a hand-held electric mixer and mix on high speed for 8 minutes.Add the vanilla.Mix for another 5 minutes or until the mixture forms shiny, stiff peaks.Use a spoon to pile high onto cooled cupcakes.

Traditional techniques, including native yeasts, extended maceration, aging in French oak barrels and bottling without filtration, enhanced the wine's complexity. This wine is delicious with many entrees and cheeses. One of our favorite food pairings is roast turkey with a wild mushroom and walnut stuffing. Roast leg of lamb, rubbed with fragrant herbs and spices, or grilled pork loin also marry perfectly with the wine's luscious flavors.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438573-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":25,"score":0.7868421052631579,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Frobert-mondavi-napa-merlot-1999%2F51817"}]},"instructions":"Combine mustard, wasabi and 1 tsp water in a bowl.

        In a large bowl, use your hands to gently combine ground sirloin and brisket.

Meanwhile, heat a griddle, large cast-iron skillet, or large heavy stainless-steel skillet over medium-high heat. Melt 2 tablespoons butter and place the buns, cut-side down, in the pan. Cook until cut sides are golden-brown, about 2 minutes (you may need to do this in two batches, using additional butter if needed).

Use the handle of the other to hammer the spatula down, smashing the patty until 1/2 inch thick. (You'll have to hammer harder and longer then you might think.) Press down and slide the spatula to remove it without tearing the patty; generously season patty with salt and pepper.

Special Equipment: a jumbo 6-cup muffin tin and jumbo muffin liners                          Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a jumbo 6-cup muffin tin with jumbo liners and generously grease with cooking spray.                          Cook the eggs: Put 6 cold eggs in a medium saucepan. Add enough water to cover by about 1 inch. Bring to a boil, cover, remove from the heat and let sit for 4 minutes. Transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water. Gently crack the eggs so that they fracture all over and let them sit in the water for at least 20 minutes.                          Gently peel the eggs under cold running water. (Older eggs are easier to peel.)                          Make the muffin batter: Melt the 2 tablespoons of soft butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Once the butter starts to foam and cook, add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Add the ham and 1/4 teaspoon salt and continue to stir until browned in spots, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the thyme. Cool in the skillet.                          Combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl.                          Whisk together the milk, sour cream, 4 tablespoons of the melted butter and the 3 remaining eggs in a separate small bowl. Fold the egg mixture, onion mixture, Cheddar and Parmesan into the dry ingredients until just combined (don't fret if there are lumps; it means your batter isn't over-mixed).                          Divide half of the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups. Stand one egg in each cup, nestling it slightly in the batter. Spoon the remaining batter on top of the eggs, using the back of your spoon to spread the batter to make sure each egg is completely covered.                          Lightly brush the top of the batter in the cups with the remaining 2 tablespoons of melted butter. Sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Bake until the muffin tops are golden, 35 to 40 minutes. Let the muffins rest in the hot muffin tin for at least 10 minutes. Remove, cut each muffin in half and serve warm, or transfer to a rack to cool to room temperature, cut and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Special Equipment: a jumbo 6-cup muffin tin and jumbo muffin liners","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404676,"name":"muffin liners","image":"muffin-or-cupcake-forms.png"},{"id":404671,"name":"muffin tray","image":"muffin-tray.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Set aside.In a medium-size bowl, whisk together dry ingredients and set aside.In a large bowl, whisk together egg, almond extract, and honey. Then, add in melted coconut oil and whisk again.Slowly add dry ingredients to wet until your dough is formed. Use a wooden spoon at first and then switch to using your hands. The dough may seem crumbly at first, but continue to knead dough together until it forms a ball.At this point, you can add your food coloring. We suggest starting off with just a few drops and kneading the food coloring into the dough. You can also make multiple colors of dough by separating in half or thirds.Create a ball with your dough and wrap with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator for 30 minutes.Once the dough has cooled. Remove from fridge and sprinkle coconut flour onto a hard, cool surface as well as your rolling pin. Then, use rolling pin to roll out the dough so that its around 1/4 to 1/2 of an inch thick. If its sticking, sprinkle on some more coconut flour.Use small/medium cookie cutters to create sugar cookie cut outs. Place shapes onto your parchment-lined baking sheet. Dont worry about spacing too much, the cookies will not expand that much.Bake at 350F for 6-8 minutes or until cookies begin to brown. They cook fast, so be careful!Immediately remove from hot pan and place on cookie rack. Let cool for at least 30 minutes before frosting.For the icing: add water to powdered sugar one tablespoon at a time and mix. Add enough water, until youve reached your desired thickness. If you want to color your frosting, add a few drops of whatever color you desire. Then, transfer into a piping bag (or plastic bag) and frost away! Frost cookies with icing and then decorate with sprinkles and edible glitter.Will stay for up to 5-7 days in an airtight container.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

Lightly grease a 2-quart, deep-dish casserole pan.                        Place the sweet potato, russet potato, and carrot each in separate saucepans. Pour enough water into each saucepan to cover the vegetables. Place each saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Cook each until tender enough to pierce with a fork, 5 to 7 minutes; drain. Set the carrots aside.                        Place the drained sweet potato and russet potato in a large mixing bowl; mash lightly. Add the egg substitute and sour cream. Blend the potato mixture with an electric hand mixer set to medium until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.                        Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the turkey in the hot oil until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the onion, celery, garlic, 1 teaspoon thyme, and poultry seasoning. Cook until the turkey is cooked through and no longer pink. Increase the heat to medium-high. Pour the chicken stock into the turkey mixture. Whisk together the hot milk and flour until smooth. When the chicken stock begins to boil, add the flour mixture to the stock and stir until it thickens. Remove from heat and stir in Worcestershire sauce and browning sauce.                        Pour the turkey mixture into the bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle the stuffing mix over the turkey mixture. Arrange the carrots, peas, and corn atop the stuffing mix.

Bake in preheated oven until top is slightly browned, about 35 minutes.
