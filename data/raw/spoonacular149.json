Brush the bottom and sides of a 9 or 10\" springform pan with pure vegetable shortening or oil. Trace the pan on parchment paper and cut the round to fit the bottom of the pan.In a mixing bowl, mix together the coconut oil, brown sugar, flax \"egg,\" and vanilla extract. Add the dry ingredients and using an electric hand mixer, mix on low until crumbly. Stop the mixer and use your fingers to press the dough together into a ball.Press the dough onto the bottom and about 1½\" up the sides of the springform pan. Prick the bottom of the dough with a fork all over. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool completely.For coconut cream pudding: In a saucepan, mix together the cornstarch, sugar, and salt. Whisk in the coconut and almond milk. Bring to a simmer and cook until thick, whisking constantly. Remove from the heat and whisk in the coconut oil and vanilla extract. Transfer to a clean bowl and allow to cool. Press a piece of plastic wrap against the surface and chill until ready to use. Before assembling tart, stir in the toasted coconut.For chocolate ganache: Place all of the ingredients in a glass, microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on 50% power for 30 seconds and stir. Continue heating at 10-20 second intervals, just until most of the chocolate is melted, the rest will melt as you stir it. (Be careful not to let it burn.) Pour into the cooled crust and chill until set. (If you want a thicker chocolate layer, double this recipe.)For caramel sauce topping: Combine brown sugar, almond milk, brown rice syrup and salt together in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook until thick and syrupy. (Test by dropping some onto a plate to see if it sets up a bit. Or it should read the \"thread\" stage on a candy thermometer, or about 225-230 degrees F.)Carefully pour the syrup into a clean, heat-proof jar and allow to cool slightly before using. (You won't need all of it.)To assemble: Spread the coconut cream pudding over the chocolate layer and let chill until set. Top with a good drizzle of the caramel sauce and sprinkle the top liberally with the toasted coconut.Allow to chill for about 30 minutes before serving.

Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428219,"title":"Vampire Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"This dry, zestful combination is reminiscent of ripe pears and roses","price":"$17.95","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428219-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9,"ratingCount":3,"score":0.8,"link":"https://www.amazon.com/2015-Vampire-Pinot-Grigio-Wine/dp/B00PSQ589E?tag=spoonacular-20"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 425F.

medium saucepan. Cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes. Put the cranberries in a large bowl and pour the sugar syrup over them; let sit 1 hour. Whisk the remaining 3/4 cup granulated sugar with the cardamom in a large bowl. Drain the cranberries, add to the spiced sugar and toss to coat. Spread the cranberries and sugar on a rimmed baking sheet. Let sit, rerolling the cranberries in the sugar occasionally until dry, 2 to 3 hours.                          Meanwhile, make the cake: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Coat two 9-inch round cake pans with cooking spray and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Coat the parchment with cooking spray. Whisk the all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, allspice and cardamom in a large bowl; set aside. Put the cocoa powder in a separate large bowl. Heat 1 cup water in a small saucepan until almost simmering; pour over the cocoa powder and whisk until smooth. Set aside until slightly cooled, about 10 minutes.                          Add the eggs to the cocoa mixture and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until just combined. Add the granulated sugar, buttermilk, vegetable oil and vanilla; beat until combined. Reduce the mixer speed to low; gradually add the flour mixture, then increase the speed to medium and beat until smooth, about 1 minute. Divide the batter evenly between the cake pans; lightly tap on the counter to remove any air bubbles. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 10 minutes in the pans, then invert the cakes onto the rack to cool completely. Remove the parchment. (The cake layers can be made 1 day ahead; let cool, then wrap tightly in plastic wrap.)                          Make the frosting: Beat the butter, confectioners' sugar and salt in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until just combined. Add the vanilla and almond extracts; increase the mixer speed to high and beat, scraping down the side of the bowl, until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the milk and almond liqueur; beat until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 more minutes.                          Halve 1/2 cup of the sugared cranberries. Place one cake layer on a plate or cake stand. Spread with 1 cup frosting, then sprinkle with the halved cranberries. Top with the second cake layer. Cover the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting. Top with the remaining sugared cranberries.

Set aside.Place the chicken pieces into a medium-sized bowl. Sprinkle the spice mixture evenly over the chicken and stir to coat all of the pieces completely. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the chicken stand at room temperature for 30 minutes (or in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours).In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion, garlic and jalepeno and cook, stirring constantly, until the onions are soft and translucent (about 5 minutes). Remove the onion mixture to a clean bowl, reserving the drippings in the skillet. Sautee half the chicken in the skillet for about 2-3 minutes or until the chicken is tender and no pink remains. Remove the chicken from the pan and place into the bowl with the cooked onion mixture.

Butter a 13 by 9-inch baking dish. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, whisk together yeast, 1/2 tsp of the granulated sugar (from the 1/2 cup) and the water. Let rest 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, whisk together rice flour, potato starch, tapioca flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, baking soda and salt for 30 seconds, set aside.To the proofed yeast mixture, add warm milk, the remainder of the 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup butter, the canola oil and eggs and blend mixture with paddle attachment to combine (mixture will be slightly lumpy but will smooth when dry ing. are added). With mixer set on low speed, slowly add in dry ingredients. Once dry ingredients have been incorporated, increase mixer speed to medium-low and mix 2 minutes.Spread two long sheets of plastic wrap onto countertop one slightly overlapping the other (you will be using it to roll the dough up since it is sticky and rather fragile. You'll need the plastic wrap it to be wide enough so you'll likely have to use two sheets unless you have really wide plastic wrap because it needs to be at least 15 inches wide - for the 13-inch side since you need to leave at least a 1-inch rim on edges for rolling). Dust plastic wrap lightly with rice flour then drop dough mixture onto plastic wrap. Sprinkle top of dough lightly with rice flour then spread two more long sheets of plastic wrap over dough, then roll dough out into a 16 by 13-inch rectangle. For the filling: spread 6 Tbsp partially melted butter over dough, then in a bowl, whisk together brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon and 1/8 tsp salt and sprinkle evenly over melted butter (leaving a small rim uncovered along all edges). Starting on the 16-inch side, roll dough snuggly to opposite side using plastic wrap to lift and roll the dough, and tucking as needed. Press end seam together with fingertips. Cut dough into 12 equal portions (don't saw back and forth with knife, just do one cut downward). Carefully lift rolls to prepared baking dish, aligning them side by side (you'll have a little extra space on one end which is fine, you can either tuck a rolled up piece of greased foil there or just leave it and the rolls on that end will spread a little more). Bake in preheated oven 22 - 25 minutes. Cool slightly then frost with cream cheese icing. Best served day prepared. Store in an airtight container and re-warm individually in microwave 10 - 20 seconds (as they are best served warm).For the cream cheese icing:In the bowl of an electric stand mixer (or using a hand mixer), whip together cream cheese and butter until smooth and fluffy. Add powdered sugar, sour cream and vanilla and whip until fluffy, about 2 minutes longer.Recipe Source: Cooking Classy","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

good option is to place the loaf in a preheated 200°F oven after it has been turned off. If you have a baguette pan, line it with foil then spray with nonstick cooking spray and sprinkle with cornmeal. If you are using a cookie sheet instead, line it with foil and sprinkle cornmeal onto the foil, then line up two dowels or other forms to help keep the bread in the long thin shape while it’s rising and cooking; wrap these dowels with aluminum foil and spray all the foil with cooking oil.In a small bowl, mix the sugar, yeast, and very warm water and set aside to proof for 5 minutes (if, after 5 minutes, the yeast is not bubbling, throw it out and start again with fresh yeast).In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour and salt. With the beater blade or dough hook on your mixer, slowly work in the yeast mixture with the flour and salt.Once fully integrated, beat an additional 2 minutes on medium-high. The dough will be very wet at this point.Scoop the dough into a gallon-size zip-top bag with 2 inches cut from a bottom corner of the bag.Squeeze the bag to remove the air then squeeze the dough through the cut hole to form one long loaf in your prepared baguette pan or in between your prepared dowels on the parchment-lined cookie sheet.Gently brush the milk or mixed egg wash all over the exposed areas of the loaf with a pastry brush.Cover the loaf with wax paper sprayed with cooking spray and set it in your warmed oven or other proofing spot for 20 minutes.Preheat the oven to 400°F and place a baking pan with water onto the bottom shelf of the oven. Leave this pan in the oven during the baking process as well—the humidity created by this heated water will help the bread to form an extra crunchy crust.Once risen, uncover the baguette and make 3 or 4 diagonal cuts into the dough with a serrated knife, cutting approximately 1/4 inch deep. Using a clean spray bottle, spritz the dough well with water before baking.Bake for 20 minutes and brush the top of the bread with milk or egg wash again, then bake for 20 minutes more, or until a toothpick inserted into the bread comes out clean and the internal temperature of the bread is 205–210°F.Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack until ready to serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare a proofing area to let your loaf rise; a good option is to place the loaf in a preheated 200°F oven after it has been turned off.

chocolate 2 tablespoons heavy cream 4 tablespoons powdered sugar, sifted 5-8 tablespoons water, warmInstructions:Cupcakes:1. In a bowl, add both flours and whisk to combine; set aside. In another bowl cream the butter on medium speed until smooth. Gradually add the sugar and beat until fluffy, about three minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition; set aside. In another bowl add milk, banana puree, and vanilla extract whisking to combine.2. Add the dry ingredients in three parts, alternating with the milk, banana and vanilla mixture. With each addition, beat until the ingredients are incorporated but do not over-beat. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the batter in the bowl to make sure the ingredients are well combined. Fill cupcake liners 3/4 full and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a cake tester (toothpick) inserted into the center of the cupcake comes out clean. Cool the cupcakes in tins for 15 minutes. Remove from the tins and cool completely on a wire rack before icing.Banana Cream Custard Filling:1. Place all ingredients in a food processor bowl or blender and process to combine. Pour mixture into a saucepan over a medium heat and cook until mixture starts to bubble, making sure to constantly whisk. Continue to cook the mixture until it thickens, about 5-7 minutes, or until it coats the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.Classic Vanilla Buttercream Frosting:1. Combine egg whites and sugar in a bowl placed over simmering water. Bring mixture to 150 degrees F while whisking constantly.2. Transfer mixture to stand mixer bowl, fitted with a whisk attachment and beat on medium speed until mixture cools and doubles in volume.3. Add butter one piece at a time, mixing to incorporate after each addition. Add salt and vanilla and mix to combine.The frosting may appear to look separated, keep mixing and and it will come together (this commonly happens when making Swiss Meringue Buttercream.)Chocolate Dipping Sauce:1. Place chocolate and heavy cream in a bowl over simmering water. Let chocolate and cream sit for 2-3 minutes to melt without stirring. Then slowly stir mixture to combine. Add powdered sugar and mix to combine. Add water one tablespoon at a time, mixing after each addition until pouring consistency is reached. Set aside and let sauce cool to warm.To assemble:1. To stuff the cupcakes: Create a well in the center of the cupcake using either apple corer, the large end of cupcake tip, or hand-carve a well using a paring knife. Fill well with banana cream custard filling.2. To frost the cupcakes: Fill a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip and start piping from the outside working in to the center to create one even layer. Freeze cupcakes for 20 minutes before dipping in warm chocolate sauce, so that the buttercream frosting does not melt. Remove cupcakes and dip in warm chocolate sauce, and then rim with nonpareils. Return cupcakes to freezer for five minutes for chocolate to set. Remove from freezer and finish piping frosting on top and garnish with a Maraschino cherry.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cupcakes:1 1/2 cups self-rising flour1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened2 cups sugar4 large eggs, at room temperature1 cup milk1 cup banana puree1 teaspoon vanilla extract","ingredients":[{"id":1145,"name":"unsalted butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":2050,"name":"vanilla extract","image":"vanilla-extract.jpg"},{"id":9040,"name":"banana","image":"bananas.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"egg.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Banana Cream Custard Filling:1  bananas1 cup milk1 cup heavy cream cup corn starch cup sugar, plus 2 tablespoon sugar1 tablespoon vanilla kosher salt","ingredients":[{"id":2050,"name":"vanilla","image":"vanilla.jpg"},{"id":9040,"name":"banana","image":"bananas.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Classic Vanilla Buttercream Frosting:** a correction was made on 5/23/11 to reflect a typo on the vanilla extract portion **5 large egg whites11/2 cup sugar4 sticks unsalted butter, diced and softened1/4 teaspoon salt1 1/2 teaspoons vanillas extract","ingredients":[{"id":1145,"name":"unsalted butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":2050,"name":"vanilla extract","image":"vanilla-extract.jpg"},{"id":2050,"name":"vanilla","image":"vanilla.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"egg.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Chocolate Dipping Sauce: 2/3 cups dark chocolate 2 tablespoons heavy cream 4 tablespoons powdered sugar, sifted 5-8 tablespoons water, warm","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"In a bowl, add both flours and whisk to combine; set aside.
