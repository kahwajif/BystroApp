Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. The Director's Merlot with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 21 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428445,"title":"Director's Merlot","description":"Our 2014 Director's Merlot offers lushness and a round, full palate. Its fragrance demonstrates red and black fruit with hints of anise and spiced wood. Juicy upon entry, the wine broadens and becomes velvety on the palate with flavors of plum, loganberry and black cherry accentuated by subtle spice notes of espresso bean and toasted vanilla. Medium tannins support the body of this wine, offering sophistication in its finish. Pairs nicely with brisket, grilled pork chops and linguine with pesto.","price":"$21.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428445-312x231.jpg","averageRating":1,"ratingCount":1,"score":0.75,"link":"https://www.amazon.com/2014-Directors-Merlot-750-mL/dp/B073XVS4MB?tag=spoonacular-20"}]},"instructions":"Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees and spray a 7in x 11in baking dish with cooking spray.Cook pasta according to package directions and then set aside.Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.

                                                     For the chicken jus: Deeply brown the backs and necks in pure olive oil in a wide pan. Add the sliced onion and carrot, and cooked until softened. Deglaze with white wine, scraping up any bits that cling to the bottom of the pan. Reduce until almost dry.

If it’s not super-fresh, first rest in a narrow-slotted spoon, letting the thin white drain away, and then transfer the remaining yolk and thick white to a small bowl. Beat the egg vigorously with a fork for 30 seconds. Set a medium saucepan filled with 4 inch (10 cm) of water over medium heat. Put a strainer in the sink.  When the water is at a low boil, add a few large pinches of salt, then stir in a clockwise direction to create a whirlpool. Pour the egg into the moving water, cover the pan and count to 20. Turn off the heat and uncover the pan. The egg should be floating on the surface in ribbons. While holding back the egg with a spoon, pour off most of the water over the strainer. Gently slide the egg into the strainer and press lightly to expel any excess liquid. Season with salt, and then overturn onto a small plate. Season with a little more salt and then sprinkle seaweed powder over in an even layer.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Cut the radishes in different shapes and textures.

There are no right answers—taste the radishes and season them the way that seems to best highlight their special qualities. Top the egg with the radish pieces, and transfer to a shallow bowl.

Line an 8x8-inch baking dish with parchment or aluminum foil, if using foil spray with cooking spray or brush with melted butter. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, granulated sugar, brown sugar and salt until well blended. Using a wooden spoon stir in melted butter and mix until combined. Add eggs and vanilla and stir until blended (mixture will be thick). Fold in 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Pour mixture into prepared baking dish and bake in preheated oven 35 - 37 minutes (underbake slightly as you'll be returning them to oven to cook marshmallows). Remove from oven and sprinkle top evenly with marshmallows then return to oven and bake about 4 minutes longer until marshmallows puff slightly. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes then toast tops of marshmallows with a kitchen torch if desired (be very carefully around parchment paper - I lit mine on fire. oops). Pour and spread chocolate frosting evenly over top (just after preparing frosting as it will begin to set as it cools), sprinkle top with remaining nuts. Allow to cool completely if desired (and if you have the patience to wait, it will take about 2 hours), or allow to cool slightly (you'll have runny frosting and unevenly cut brownies - but they are amazing this way). Cut into squares and store in an airtight container.For the chocolate frosting:In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Add milk and cocoa powder and cook whisking constantly until mixture has thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and using an electric hand mixer, stir in vanilla and powdered sugar.

combine the salt, pepper, paprika, thyme, basil and chili powder (if using).     FOR THE INSTANT POT METHOD (THAWED CHICKEN):   Carefully loosen the skin from the chicken breast with your hands lifting and separating the meat. Gently rub half of oil followed by half of the seasonings under the skin using your hands and fingers. Next, rub the outside skin of the chicken with another tablespoon of oil and the other third of the seasonings and rub in.    Optional: place the onion, garlic cloves and lemon inside the cavity of the chicken.   Press the SAUTE button HIGH and heat 1 tablespoon olive oil.   Place the chicken - breast side down, and sear for 5-7 minutes, or until a golden brown. Using tongs and a spatula, flip chicken over and sear for another 5-6 minutes. Remove chicken and place on a large platter. Place the trivet (that came with the Instant Pot or use another) inside the inner pot of the Instant Pot. Pour water or chicken broth inside. Place chicken on top of trivet, breast side up.   Cover and lock lid. Turn the valve to SEALING.   Press the MANUAL or HIGH PRESSURE button and set to 24 minutes if your chicken is four pounds. If it's smaller or larger, calculate how much time it should cook by multiplying the number of pounds by 6 minutes. So, a 3 pound chicken would be 18 minutes and a five pound chicken would be 30. For a FROZEN WHOLE CHICKEN - set to 42 minutes ON HIGH for a 4 lb chicken. Allow the Instant Pot to come to pressure (this may take about 10-15 minutes).   Once the 24 minutes is up and the Instant Pot beeps indicating the chicken is done, allow to naturally release for at least 15 minutes and then quick release for any extra pressure.   Open lid and transfer chicken to a platter or a large cutting board. Optional: Broil in the oven for 4-5 minutes to crisp up the skin.    Slice or shred and serve with your favorite sides.     TO ROAST IN THE OVEN INSTEAD:   Preheat oven to 450 F. Place chicken on an oven roaster and cook for approximately 30 minutes. Cover loosely with foil and cook for an additional 40-50minutes or until temperature reads 165 F.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"FOR THE INSTANT POT METHOD (THAWED CHICKEN):   Carefully loosen the skin from the chicken breast with your hands lifting and separating the meat.

In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish.
