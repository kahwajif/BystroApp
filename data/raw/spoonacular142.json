Switch mixer to medium speed and add the the sugar, vanilla, and almond extracts. Scrape down the sides and the bottom of the bowl as needed. Turn the mixer off and pour the flour into the wet ingredients. Turn the mixer on low and slowly beat until a very soft dough is formed.  Press the dough down to compact it and tightly cover with plastic wrap to chill until firm, at least 2 hours.Preheat oven to 350F degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats (silicone mats preferred to reduce spreading). Shape the cookie dough into balls. Mine were about 1 Tablespoon of dough per ball. Make sure they're nice and smooth. Make an indentation with your thumb into each ball. The dough may crack slightly when you press your thumb into it. Simply smooth it out with your fingers if you can. Otherwise, it's perfectly fine to have a few cracks. Fill each with a scant 1/2 teaspoon of jam. (Or however much it can hold.)Bake the shortbread thumbprint cookies for 14-15 minutes, or until very lightly browned on the edges. The cookies will puff up and spread slightly. Do not overbake.  In fact, I only baked mine for 13-14 minutes. I prefer them a little soft. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack. Allow to cool for at least 30 minutes before glazing.Make the glaze: stir together glaze ingredients until smooth. Add more liquid to thin out or add more powdered sugar to thicken to your desired consistency. Drizzle over cooled cookies. Glaze will set within a couple hours.Store cookies covered at room temperature for 3 days or in the refrigerator for 6 days.

Save the greens for another time. Wash the beets well and place them in a roasting pan with a -inch layer of water on the bottom. Cover tightly with foil (if the foil touches the beets, cover first with parchment, then with foil.) Roast about 50 minutes (or longer for larger beets). When the beets are done, carefully remove the foil. Allow them to cool, and then peel them by slipping off the skins with your fingers. Cut them into -inch wedges.Slice the stem and bottom ends from the blood oranges. Stand the oranges on one end and, following the contour of the fruit with a very sharp knife, remove the peel and white pith. Work from top to bottom, rotating the fruit as you go. Then hold each orange over a bowl and carefully slice between the membranes and the fruit to release the segments in between. Squeeze any juice left in the remaining membrane into a measuring cup. Add any juice from the bowl of blood orange segments to the measuring cup. (Or if you're pressed for time, just slice the oranges into rounds.)Combine the diced shallot, lemon juice,  cup blood orange juice (if you didnt reserve enough, you can add regular freshly squeezed orange juice), honey and  teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Whisk in the olive oil slowly. Add black pepper and additional sea salt to taste.Remove the salmon from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking to bring it to room temperature. Season the salmon with the zest, sea salt, and ground pepper.Heat a large saut pan over medium heat for about 1 minute. Add the oil to the pan and allow to heat up for 1 minute, until very warm, but not smoking. Lay the fish in the pan, seasoned side down, and cook 3 to 4 minutes, until it is lightly browned. Turn the fish over, lower the heat to medium-low, and cook a few minutes more, until it is almost cooked through. Do your best not to overcook the salmon. When it is done, the fish will begin to flake and separate a little, and the center will be slightly rare. The salmon will continue to cook a bit more while it sits.Place the spinach in a bowl and toss lightly with some dressing. Transfer to a serving platter.

(olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, brown sugar, soy sauce, Dijon, and some freshly cracked pepper).Cut the mushrooms, bell pepper, zucchini, and onion into one-inch cubes, or as close to that size as possible. Leave the grape tomatoes whole. Place the vegetables in a gallon-sized zip top bag and pour the marinade over top. Massage the bag to mix the vegetables with the marinade. Let them marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature, flipping the bag occasionally to redistribute the marinade.While the vegetables are marinating, begin the rice. Combine the uncooked rice, water, minced garlic, and salt in a medium pot. Place a lid on top and bring the pot up to a boil over high heat. As soon as it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and let the pot simmer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, turn the heat off and let it rest for 5 more minutes, then fluff with a fork. Allow the rice to cool slightly.While the rice is cooking, prepare the lemon parsley mix. Pull the leaves from about  bunch of parsley. Finely chop the leaves until they appear minced. Use a zester, microplane, or small-holed cheese grater to remove the zest from one lemon. Combine the minced parsley, about  Tbsp lemon zest, and olive oil in a small bowl.When the rice has cooled just slightly, add the lemon parsley mix and fold gently until the rice is coated in parsley, lemon, and olive oil. Avoid vigorous stirring, as this can make the rice pasty.Adjust the oven rack to the second position from the top and preheat the broiler on high. Cover a large baking sheet with parchment. Spread the marinated vegetables out over the surface of the baking sheet. If they do not cover the sheet in a single layer, use two baking sheets to avoid over crowding.Broil the vegetables about 6-8 inches from the flame for 10 minutes, or until they achieve a subtle char on the edges. Every broiler is slightly different, so keep a close eye on them and turn the baking sheet as needed. For more even broiling, stir the vegetables half way through.Fill each bowl with a scoop of lemon parsley rice and a pile of the broiled balsamic vegetables.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small bowl, stir together the ingredients for the balsamic marinade (olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, brown sugar, soy sauce, Dijon, and some freshly cracked pepper).","ingredients":[{"id":2069,"name":"balsamic vinegar","image":"balsamic-vinegar.jpg"},{"id":19334,"name":"brown sugar","image":"dark-brown-sugar.png"},{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":16124,"name":"soy sauce","image":"soy-sauce.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Cut the mushrooms, bell pepper, zucchini, and onion into one-inch cubes, or as close to that size as possible.

Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the pudding mix, cocoa, espresso granules, and beat on low speed until just combined, about 1 minute. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the flour, baking soda, optional salt, and beat on low speed until just combined, about 1 minute. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the Andes chips, chopped chocolate, and beat on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds. Using a large cookie scoop, 1/4-cup measure, or your hands, form approximately 14 equal-sized mounds of dough. Roll into balls, and flatten slightly. Place mounds on a large plate or tray, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, up to 5 days. Do not bake with unchilled dough because cookies will bake thinner, flatter, and be more prone to spreading. Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with a Silpat or spray with cooking spray. Place dough mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (I bake 8 cookies per sheet) and bake for about 10 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just set, even if slightly undercooked and glossy in the center. Don't overbake which is easy to do with dark cookies. Cookies firm up as they cool. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for about 10 minutes before serving. I let them cool on the baking sheet and don't use a rack.  Cookies are best warm and fresh, but will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months. Alternatively, unbaked cookie dough can be stored airtight in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 6 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.

It is aromatically complex with layers of blue and black fruit, Indian spices, coffee hints, and pepper. In the mouth the blue/black fruit flavors and eastern spice notes are layered with a \"sauvage\" sense of wildness. Texturally layered, its flavors vary in intensity and quality over your tongue and palate.

In a large skillet over medium heat, add the oil and heat to a shimmer. Add Trisha's Pulled Pork, the chili powder, garlic powder, salt, cumin and black pepper; stir to combine. Add enough reserved cooking liquid to coat the meat but not saturate it. Cook until the meat starts to brown and the spices become fragrant, 8 to 10 minutes.

Add the ribs and sear until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Remove the ribs and transfer to a plate. Add the garlic, carrots and onion and cook until golden and caramelized, about 10 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Add 1 cup of water and, using a wooden spoon, scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add 2 more cups of water and stir to combine.                          Return the ribs to the Dutch oven, cover and reduce the heat to low.

In a large skillet, heat the oil to a shimmer and add the cakes. Fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, then flip and continue cooking until golden brown on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels.                          In a medium skillet over high heat, heat the oil until it shimmers.

Cut a piece of foil 9 by 20-inches. Butter the corners and sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Line the pan with the foil so that the excess hangs over at each of the short sides of the pan.                          Whisk the flour in a medium bowl with the baking powder, baking soda and salt. Whisk in 1/2 cup peanuts.                          Put the melted butter in a large bowl and use a rubber spatula to stir in the sugars. Stir vigorously, mashing the brown sugar lumps with the spatula, so that the mixture is well combined and creamy. Using the rubber spatula, stir in the peanut butter, again making sure the mixture is well combined. Stir in the eggs and vanilla. Fold in the flour mixture until just combined.                          Scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Press the back of a spoon or a curved rubber spatula into the batter to make little wells all over the batter, making sure not to push down to the bottom of the pan. Spoon the jam into the wells, making sure the jam is distributed evenly across the pan. Use a knife to pull the jam through the peanut butter mixture-it won't exactly ribbon, you will end up with some chunks of jam throughout. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup chopped peanuts over the top.                          Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of a non-jammy spot comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool completely on a rack, about 1 hour.                          When the bar has cooled completely, place a lightweight cutting board or a baking rack over the top of the pan. Flip and set on the counter. Gently pull the pan from the foil and the foil from the pan to remove. Gently peel the foil off the bar. Place another lightweight cutting board on top, and flip the bar right-side-up. For easier slicing, wrap with plastic wrap, and let sit at room temperature overnight. Cut into forty eight 1 1/2-inch squares.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":350,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Cut a piece of foil 9 by 20-inches.

processor and pulse until mixed. Add about one third of the chilled butter and process until thoroughly combined (the mixture will be slightly yellow). Add the remaining chilled butter and pulse until the mixture resembles very coarse meal with pea-size bits of butter. Add the vinegar in a single pulse. Gradually add the ice water through the feed tube pulsing just until evenly combined. Squeeze a handful of the dough together, it should just hold its shape and be a little crumbly. If still very powdery, pulse again, adding up to 2 tablespoons ice water.                          Turn the dough out on a work surface. Pat about two thirds of the dough into a square about 1/2-inch thick. Repeat with the remaining dough. Wrap each piece tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.                          Adjust an oven rack to the bottom position and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch-square baking dish.                          For the filling: Toss the tomatoes with 2 teaspoons salt in a large colander set over a large bowl. Let stand, gently tossing about every 10 minutes, until the tomatoes release some of their juices, about 30 minutes. Drain the juices from the bowl, add the drained tomatoes and toss with the brown sugar and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt.                          Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer the onion to a medium bowl, stir in the thyme and let cool. Add the pepper Jack, mozzarella, parsley, scallions, mayonnaise, 1/4 cup of the breadcrumbs and the garlic to the onions and stir to combine.                          To assemble the pie: Let the dough stand at room temperature for a few minutes until slightly softened to make rolling easier. Place the larger piece of dough between two large pieces of floured parchment; roll into a rough 14-inch square (if the dough gets too soft, pop it in the fridge to firm up and then continue rolling). Roll the remaining dough into a rough 12-inch square.                          Transfer the larger piece of dough to the prepared baking dish. Gently press the dough along the bottom and up the sides of the dish. There will be overhang on all sides. Sprinkle the bottom with the remaining 1 tablespoon breadcrumbs; top with the cheese mixture spreading it in an even layer. Then add the tomatoes. Dot with the butter. Put the remaining dough over the filling, lining up the edges with the bottom piece of dough as best you can. Pinch the edges together, trim any excess, then fold and crimp to create a tight seal. Brush the top and edges of the crust with the egg and cut decorative slits in the top of the pie.                          Bake until the crust is dark golden brown and the filling bubbles out a little through the slits, 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes. (If the crust browns too quickly, cover the pie loosely with foil.) Let cool at least 2 hours before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Special equipment: An 8-inch-square baking dish","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404646,"name":"baking pan","image":"roasting-pan.jpg"}]}]},{"name":"For the dough","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine the flour, Parmesan, sugar and salt in a food processor and pulse until mixed.","ingredients":[{"id":1033,"name":"parmesan","image":"parmesan.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"food-processor.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add about one third of the chilled butter and process until thoroughly combined (the mixture will be slightly yellow).","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the remaining chilled butter and pulse until the mixture resembles very coarse meal with pea-size bits of butter.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the vinegar in a single pulse.

I don't like the sauce to be too \"garlicky\", so instead of mincing the garlic, I smash it with the back of a knife, place it into the sauce and let it sit there while the shrimp is grilling. I then take out and discard the garlic clove before serving it. That way, the sauce will have a nice, mild garlic flavor but won't be too overpowering.Place the shrimp on the preheated grill and grill until you have nicely charred grill marks, 4-5 minutes, flip them onto the other side and only grill for another 1-2 minutes. Shrimp cooks SO fast, so don't be tempted to cook it longer, or the shrimp will be rubbery and dry.Serve with the Creamy Avocado Sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the grill to high heat, for at least 15 minutes.

                                            Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a 15 x 10 x 1-inch baking sheet with parchment paper. Spray the parchment with nonstick cooking spray.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            In a large bowl, beat egg yolks on high speed until thick and yellow. Gradually add 1/2 cup of the sugar and all of the pumpkin, beating on high until sugar is mostly dissolved.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            In a small bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining sugar, beating until stiff peaks form. Fold into egg yolk mixture. Combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt; fold into pumpkin mixture. Spread into the prepared pan.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Cool for about 5 minutes, just long enough so that the cake has set. Turn cake onto a clean kitchen towel dusted with confectioners' sugar. Gently peel off the parchment paper. Roll up cake in the towel jelly-roll style, starting with a short side; let it cool completely on a wire rack.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Prepare the filling. In an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese, butter, confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth (it will be a spreadable consistency, slightly less stiff than a cream cheese frosting). Unroll cake; spread filling evenly, almost but not quite to the edges (when you roll it back up the frosting will fill in the uncovered ends). Roll up again. Cover and chill until firm.                                                                                                                             6                                                                            Slice off a small slice from either end of the cake to ensure that it is flat on the ends--from these scraps, if desired, you can cut a piece of the cake into a small circle, which you can affix to the side with either a bit of leftover filling or using a toothpick (this will be the \"branch\" on the side).                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Prepare the frosting. In an electric mixer, combine cream cheese and butter and beat until fluffy. Add the confectioners' sugar, bit by bit, until the frosting has reached your desired consistency (I used about 3 1/2 cups). Add the vanilla and cocoa powder and mix until fully incorporated.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Spread the frosting on the cooled cake (depending on the texture of your finished cake, you might want to apply a crumb coat first, but I found I did not need to). Let the cake chill for about half an hour, and then apply log detailing to the cake--I used Wilton's white writing icing.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            If desired, garnish with marzipan turkeys: mix a golf ball-sized piece of marzipan with food coloring (I used 2 drops of red, 4 drops of yellow and a tiny drop of green) to make a rich, burnt sienna type of cooked turkey color; separate into one large ball and two smaller ones; roll the large one into an oval, and the smaller pieces into teardrop shapes but with a blunt end; these are your drumsticks. Shape small bits of white marzipan to form mini bones and attach these to the drumstick pieces; assemble it all and add other marzipan detailing as desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 375°F.

If you're serving a selection of appetizers, you can't go wrong with these. Both are very food friendly and complement a variety of flavors. One wine you could try is Patricia Green Freedom Hill Pinot Noir. It has 4.7 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 35 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":443179,"title":"Patricia Green Freedom Hill Pinot Noir","description":"This Freedom Hill Pinot Noir has the deep pigmentation, floral aromatics, intense mid-palate sweetness and structured finishing tannins that provide the wine with enough fortitude to hold the fruit sweetness well in check. This balances at a very high level. For all the dry extract-laden fruit here there is a wealth of acidity and tannin that are actually the dominant forces in the wine and ensure that this is a focused, smart and incredibly delicious Pinot Noir. This has so much to it that it will drink well almost immediately but has an upside that is clearly well more than a decade away.","price":"$34.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/443179-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":7,"score":0.8945454545454546,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fpatricia-green-freedom-hill-pinot-noir-2015%2F166641"}]},"instructions":"Cook and mash the beans: Prepare the beans by sautéing onions in oil until softened in a large, thick-bottomed skillet. Add ground cumin and cook an additional 30 seconds. Add the beans, a teaspoon of salt, and a cup of water.\nUse a potato masher to mash the beans into the pan, until the consistency of (somewhat lumpy) mashed potatoes. Cook for a few minutes on medium hight heat until water is absorbed.\nStir in the Chipotle Tabasco sauce and season to taste with more salt if needed. Remove to a warm burner out of the way, cover.\n\nMake the tostada shells: To prepare the tortillas, heat the oven to 200°F. Line a baking pan with paper towels and place next to the stove. Heat 5 Tbsp of oil in a small skillet on medium high heat, until the bubbles form immediately when you insert the edge of a tortilla in it.\nUsing tongs, place a tortilla in the hot oil and let cook until golden brown on both sides, about 30 seconds per side. You can use a metal spatula to flatten down the tortilla while cooking.\n\nUse tongs to lift the cooked tortilla out of the pan, allowing the excess oil to drip off of it, back into the pan. Place the cooked tortilla on the paper towels to absorb more of the oil. Sprinkle a little salt onto each warm tortilla.\nDo each tortilla one at a time this way. As you fill up a baking pan, put the pan in the oven to keep the tortillas warm.\n\nAdd more oil as needed. Carefully monitor the oil temperature. Don't let it get too hot, or the tortillas will burn, or too cool - they won't fry up crisp enough.\n\nArrange toppings to serve: To serve, arrange the cheese, cilantro and tomatoes in separate small bowls. Put beans into a serving dish. Bring out the tortillas by batches, keeping the rest warm in the oven.\nLet people spread beans on to their tortillas and add sprinkle on the cheese, cilantro and tomatoes for each tostada.\nOptional additions are sliced lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, and salsa (though with the chipotle, you probably don't need any more heat).","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cook and mash the beans: Prepare the beans by sautéing onions in oil until softened in a large, thick-bottomed skillet.","ingredients":[{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add ground cumin and cook an additional 30 seconds.","ingredients":[{"id":1002014,"name":"ground cumin","image":"ground-cumin.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the beans, a teaspoon of salt, and a cup of water.","ingredients":[{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Use a potato masher to mash the beans into the pan, until the consistency of (somewhat lumpy) mashed potatoes.
