Keep a bowl of ice cubes and some paper towels handy to chill and dry your hands as you work.\nPat the pastry lightly with cold fingers so the base is even, and make the shell a little thicker round the sides, ensuring it reaches all the way up since it may shrink. To even the base, run an ice cube quickly across, from the centre to the edges. Chill again.\nTip the almonds and 50g/2oz sugar into the food processor and whizz until finely chopped. Dice the butter and add to the almonds with the flour. Process again until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs, then add the egg and eg yolk and process briefly until soft and creamy.

Mix well and add the beets and onions. Once it comes to a boil, stir to dissolve the sugar and salt then remove from the heat. Allow to cool then cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to overnight.                          For the grouper: In a small bowl, add the orange zest, juice, olive oil, ground achiote and cumin. Mix well to combine, then pour the marinade into a large resealable plastic bag. Add the grouper filets and seal the bag tightly, squeezing out any excess air from the bag. Gently mix around so the marinade coats the fish well. Refrigerate for 45 minutes.                          Clean the grill grates and preheat a grill to medium-high heat.                          Arrange 2 banana leaves to form a cross. Remove one piece of grouper from the marinade and place in the center of the leaves. Season with 4 to 5 turns freshly ground black pepper and 1 teaspoon salt. Wrap the fish up tightly in the banana leaves by folding over one flap at a time, alternating each side so they overlap. Secure the last folds of the leaves together with toothpicks to hold in place. Place the banana leaf-wrapped grouper on the grill, and cook until the leaves turn bright green and begin to char around the edges, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Remove from the grill and set aside.                          To serve, cut open the banana leaves to expose the fish, add a large spoonful of Spicy Grilled Corn Salsa and garnish with the pickled red onions, chopped scallions and cilantro.                          Preheat a grill to medium-high heat.                          Place the corn on the grill and cook until well charred all over, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Drizzle the poblanos and fresnos with olive oil and season with 5 to 6 turns freshly ground black pepper and 1 teaspoon salt. Place the chilies on the grill and cook until lightly charred on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Place the chiles into a bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to steam for 3 to 4 minutes.                          Hold a corn cob upright in a large mixing bowl. Using a chef's knife, cut off the kernels and let them fall into the bowl. Repeat with the remaining corn. Set aside the kernels. Discard the cobs.                          Remove the skins from the chiles. Mince the fresnos, dice the poblanos and add them to the bowl with the corn kernels. Add the red onions, scallions, lime zest, juice, garlic, agave and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Stir to combine and season with salt and pepper.

In a small glass bowl, combine the warm milk, yeast, flour, and sugar and stir to blend. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside for 30 minutes.Make the panettone dough2. Place the pistachios on a baking sheet and spray them with water, sprinkle with a pinch or two of salt, and toast for 10 minutes, watching to make sure they do not burn. Cool completely and chop coarsely.3. In a bowl, combine the 1 teaspoon salt, the flour, lemon and orange zests, candied orange and lemon peel, if using, cranberries, pistachios, rum, and vanilla.4. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium speed for 2 minutes or until fluffy. Add the eggs and yolks and beat well. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture, mixing just until combined. Gradually add the starter and continue to beat on low speed until all ingredients are incorporated. The dough should not be sticky or too firm. It should look buttery and a little ragged.5. Turn out the dough onto a floured work surface and knead for 1 to 2 minutes, pushing the dough away from you with the heels of your hands, and then folding it back over on itself. The dough will be smooth and satiny.6. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place for about 2 hours, or until doubled in size. Gently turn out the dough onto a work surface and divide it into 4 equal pieces, if making smaller loaves, or into 2 pieces if making larger loaves; keep as much air in the dough as possible. Let the pieces rest, covered with a clean dish towel, for 10 minutes.7. For the smaller panettone, butter four 1-pound coffee cans or other deep molds that are 4 to 5 inches wide. Use 2-pound coffee cans to make two large panettone. Shape each piece into a smooth ball and place the dough in the mold. It should fill half the mold.8. Beat the reserved egg whites and brush the tops of the loaves. Cover and let the loaves rise for 1 hour, or until just slightly less than doubled. (The dough may be active and rise quickly, so you may not need the full hour.)9. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).10. Uncover the panettone, place the molds on the middle rack of the oven, and reduce the heat to 350°F (175°C). Bake for 30 to 35 minutes for the smaller molds and up to 45 minutes for the larger molds. (If, after 20 minutes of baking, the top of the panettone is taking on too much color, cover loosely with a piece of aluminum foil.) The bread is done when a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool for 15 minutes, then carefully remove the loaves from the cans and place the panettone on wire racks to cool completely. Panettone will keep fresh for up to a week in a plastic bag; freeze them for up to 6 months.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the starter","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"In a small glass bowl, combine the warm milk, yeast, flour, and sugar and stir to blend.

stir with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until butter is melted and mixture is thickened, about 7 to 10 minutes. Do not allow mixture to boil or the egg yolks will curdle. Remove pan from heat.In a medium mixing bowl, combine cake flour, all purpose flour, baking powder, and salt; sift or whisk together to mix. Set aside.In a small mixing bowl, stir the milk and lemon juice together. Set aside. Tip: Dont worry if the milk appears to curdle.In a large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter, lemon zest, and sugar until light and fluffy. Tip: To cream, start by placing the butter and lemon zest in the bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed begin by beating the butter and lemon zest about 1 minute until it is smooth and light in color. With the mixer still on medium speed, slowly add the sugar to the butter, either one tablespoon at a time, or in a very slow steady stream, taking from 4 to 8 minutes to add all of the sugar, and beating until the butter and sugar are fully incorporated and the mixture is a light, or pale yellow color, with a fluffy texture. While adding the sugar, stop the mixer occasionally to scrape the mixture off the paddle and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly.With the mixer on low speed, add about one third of the flour mixture, mix just until the flour is almost completely blended. Scrape the bowl down, and add about one half of the milk mixture, blending just until mixed. Scrape the bowl down again and continue alternating with the flour mixture and milk mixture, ending with the last portion of the flour, and stirring just until blended. Set aside.In another large mixing bowl and using clean beaters, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until foamy, add the cream of tartar, and continue beating until stiff peaks form. Using a balloon type whisk or large rubber spatula, gently fold about  of the beaten egg whites into the batter to lighten the batter, and then fold the remaining egg whites in.Bake: Spoon the batter into the prepared pans and smooth the surface with the back of a large spoon. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until a long toothpick, wooden skewer, or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and place pans on a wire cooling rack to cool for 10 to 15 minutes then remove cake from the pans and place the cake on the wire cooling rack to finish cooling.In a large bowl, combine mascarpone cheese, vanilla, confectioners sugar, and whipping cream; use an electric mixer and beat together until mixture is smooth and stiff peaks form, about 2 to 4 minutes. Do not overbeat.Mascarpone frosting should be used immediately, or refrigerate until needed.Use a long serrated kitchen knife to split each cake layer into 2 horizontal layers.Place one of the split cake layers on a serving plate; spread  of the chilled lemon curd (about  cup) over the layer leaving about  inch border all around. Repeat with the second and third layers. Place the last cake layer on top.Use an offset spatula to spread Mascarpone Cheese Frosting over top and sides of cake. If desired, reserve about 1 cups frosting to decorate top using a pastry bag and pastry tip and use a pastry comb around the side of the cakePlace fresh lemon slices, cut in half, on top of cake.Cover and refrigerate before serving. Refrigerate leftovers.Immediately pour the hot mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to strain out the lemon zest pieces and any bits of egg that may have curdled. Pour into an airtight container and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. The curd will continue to thicken as it cools.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium heavy saucepan over medium-low heat, combine butter, sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, and egg yolks.Cook and stir with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until butter is melted and mixture is thickened, about 7 to 10 minutes.

Once the water is boiling, salt it with 1 Tbsp of salt. Once the water returns to a boil add the pasta to the pot. Leave uncovered, let cook on high heat with a vigorous boil. Put the timer on for 8-10 minutes, or whatever your pasta package says is appropriate for al dente (cooked but still a little firm).  Drain.2 Once you've started to heat the water, start working on the sauce.  Heat olive oil in a very large skillet on medium heat.  Add the chopped onion, Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes.  Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened.  Add the garlic, fresh thyme, season with salt and pepper.  Cook for an additional minute, until the garlic is fragrant.  Remove from heat and set aside. 3 Heat a large cast iron pan on high heat.  Salt the bottom of the pan generously.  Once the pan is hot, break up small chunks of ground beef and add them to the pan, without stirring.  (You may need to work in batches; do not crowd the pan.)  You want the meat to get well browned.  If the pan is too hot and the meat is burning, not browning, take the pan off the heat for a little, and reduce the heat to medium high.  On our coil electric stove, it takes the high heat setting for the meat to brown sufficiently, but your stove may be different.  Once the meat is browned on one side (a couple of minutes), use a metal spatula to flip the meat over to brown on the other side.  At this point, assuming you are using a cast iron pan, you can remove the pan from the heat.  The residual heat in the pan will finish cooking the meat. 4 Use a slotted spoon to lift the meat from the cast iron pan and add it to the pan with the seasoned onions.  Add tomato sauce.  Use the edge of your metal spatula to break up the bigger chunks of meat into smaller pieces.  Add basil.  Add a teaspoon of sugar. Bring to a simmer on low heat, let cook, uncovered, for 15 minutes. 5 Once the sauce has simmered for 15 minutes, adjust seasonings.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Add a little more sugar if the sauce is too acidic.  Add more tomato sauce if the sauce is a little dry.  Stir in the cooked penne pasta.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley.

Mix well.Add the milk, egg yolks, melted butter and vanilla extract.  Stir until just combined.  Transfer dough to an oiled bowl.  Cover and place in a warm (85F) location for 2 hours.To make the Apples, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Once melted, add the diced apples, cinnamon, and brown sugar.  Stir until well coated.  Add the apple cider and let cook for 9-10 minutes, or until cider is mostly reduced.  Set aside to cool.Once dough has rested, transfer it to a well-floured countertop.  Press dough out into a square approximately 10\"x10\".  Spread the cooked apples evenly around the top of the dough, and then fold the dough into thirds (like a letter).  Place dough on a parchment-lined sheet pan.  Cover and place back in a warm location for another 30 minutes.Using a deep fryer or a large Dutch oven, heat the canola or vegetable oil to 375F.  (An easy way to check the temperature is to drop a pinch of flour in the oil.  If it bubbles up and turns brown quickly, then the oil is ready to go.)On a well-floured surface, carefully press/roll the dough out into a rectangle about  thick.Cut the dough into 4-oz pieces (~1/3 cup of dough) and set pieces on a well-floured surface to rest for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, prepare the Glaze by whisking together the powdered sugar, milk and vanilla extract in a small stainless steel bowl.  Place bowl over a medium saucepan of gently boiling water (make sure water doesnt touch bottom of bowl).  Heat until Glaze is warm, stirring occasionally.Gently press/roll each piece of dough into a 4 oval.  Carefully place the dough in the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 60-90 seconds per side.  (Tip: Dont forget to flip the fritters to ensure even cooking.)Remove fritters from the oil and let dry on paper towels.While still warm, brush the fritters with the warm Glaze.Let fritters cool before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl, combine the yeast, flour, sugar, salt and cinnamon.","ingredients":[{"id":2010,"name":"cinnamon","image":"cinnamon.jpg"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"yeast-granules.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix well.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the milk, egg yolks, melted butter and vanilla extract.

Processuntil a thick paste forms (scraping down the sides of the food processor as needed). Line a cookie sheet with wax paper and scoop one tablespoon balls of truffle onto the cookie sheet (about 8). Chill until strawberries are ready.Slice the stem off the strawberry and scoop out the center with a small melon baller. Wipe the edge of the berry as dry as possible.Place chocolate in a small microwave safe bowl. I like to use paper Dixie bowls for easy clean up. Heat on high power in 30 second increments, stirring between each, until melted and smooth. Place remaining 2 Oreos into a plastic bag and crush using a rolling pin. (Those are for decoration, feel free to use sprinkles instead.) I recommend dividing the chocolate into two bowls in case it's in a finicky mood and seizes. If that happens, drizzle the chocolate over the top of the berry instead of dipping it.To assemble the berries: place an Oreo truffle in each strawberry cavity.
