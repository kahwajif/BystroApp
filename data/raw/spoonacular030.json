When the pan is hot, add the chiles and toast them about 2 minutes on each side, just until they are fragrant and beginning to darken (do this in batches if you can't fit all six at once). Set the sauté pan aside.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Put the water in a medium pot and bring to a boil.  Add the toasted chiles, half of the sliced onions, and 3 cloves of garlic cut in half.  Partially cover the pot, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes.                                                                                                                              3                                                                            While the chiles simmer, add the vegetable oil to the sauté pan over medium heat.  Add the remaining sliced onion and the grated sweet potato.  Sauté for about 10 minutes until the onions and potatoes are very soft.  Mince the remaining cloves of garlic and add to the onions and potatoes, stirring for about 30 seconds. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside. If a crust formed on the bottom of the sauté pan while the potatoes cooked, deglaze the pan with 1/4 cup of the chile liquid.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            After the chiles have simmered for 30 minutes, transfer them, along with the onions and garlic, to a blender or food processor along with 1/2 cup of the liquid (reserve the rest in the pot).  Puree until very smooth and then push the puree through a mesh strainer into a small bowl.  Discard any solids that remain in the strainer.

Spread coconut in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in preheated oven 6 - 8 minutes until golden brown, stirring once halfway through baking. Remove from oven and transfer to a bowl.In a non-reactive mixing bowl whisk together lime zest and egg yolks for 2 minutes, until mixture is slightly tinted green, Stir in sweetened condensed milk. Pour in lime juice, vanilla and coconut extract (for more coconut flavor you can add an additional 1/4 tsp coconut extract) and mix until well blended. Allow mixture to rest 30 minutes, without stirring, at room temperature to allow to thicken.Meanwhile prepare graham cracker crust by placing graham crackers and 1/4 cup toasted coconut in a food processor and pulse until finely ground, about 30 - 40 seconds. Add in light-brown sugar and melted butter and pulse just until mixture is evenly coated. Divide mixture among 12 paper lined muffin cups, spooning about 1 heaping Tbsp mixture into each cup, and press mixture into an even layer. Bake in 350 degree oven for 5 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees. Divide lime pie filling among 12 cups, pouring mixture over graham cracker crust layer and filling each cup nearly full (about 1/4 cup in each). Bake in preheated oven 14 - 16 minutes, or until cupcakes only jiggle slightly. Remove from oven and allow to cool to room temperature, about 45 minutes. Once cool cover loosely with plastic wrap and transfer to refrigerator and chill 3 hours (note, I chilled mine in the muffin pan but the butter from the crust made the cups stick to the bottoms of the pan once it was chilled - so I simply poured hot water into a cookie sheet then set the muffin pan over the warm water and removed them after about 20 seconds. You could probably lift them off of a plate easier though if you put them on a plate before refrigerating :). In a mixing bowl, using an electric hand mixer, whip heavy cream on high speed until soft peaks form. Add powdered sugar (if you want more coconut flavor you can add 1/4 tsp coconut extract to the whipped cream along with the sugar), whip until stiff peaks form.

Heat over medium-high heat until the oil is very hot but not smoking.

Remove any loose bits of potato mixture between batches with a slotted spoon.                          Serve the latkes immediately, or keep them warm in a 200 degree F oven.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"For the salsa: Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.

Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Halibut. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":452761,"title":"Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio","description":"Pinot Grigio Ramato continues a tradition of the Republic of Venice, since “ramato”, or coppery, was the term referred to Pinot Grigio in contracts. A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":5,"score":0.8175000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fattems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014%2F160114"}]},"instructions":"1. To prepare the seasoning, combine the coriander, Old Bay seasoning, salt, and pepper in a bowl and set aside (if not using immediately, transfer to an airtight container and store in a cool, dry space).2. To prepare the stew, pour 2 tablespoons of the olive oil into a saute pan and set over medium-high heat. Add the chorizo and saute for 2 to 3 minutes, until it begins to brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a mixing bowl. Using a fine-mesh strainer, strain and reserve the colored and well-flavored oil for finishing the dish.3. Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil into a saucepan and set over medium heat. Add the garlic and saute for about 1 minute, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until golden brown; the garlic should be caramelized but not burned. Add the onion, carrot, and oregano, and continue to cook for about 3 minutes, until the onion is translucent. Turn down the heat to low and add the cabbage. Cook for 3 minutes longer, stirring occasionally.4. Add the chickpeas and chicken broth, and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and continue to cook over low heat, uncovered, for 10 to 15 minutes, so that some of the broth evaporates and the flavors come together. Add the cooked chorizo and the cilantro and keep warm.5. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).6. Place the halibut fillets on a large plate and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, brushing the oil to completely cover the fish. Evenly coat each fillet with about 1 tablespoon of the reserved Seafood Seasoning. Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil into an oven-proof saute pan or skillet and set over medium-high heat. Carefully place the fillets in the pan and saute for 2 to 3 minutes, letting the fillets brown and form a crust on the first side. Turn the fillets over with a spatula and transfer the pan to the oven. Roast for about 10 minutes, until the fillets are firm and flake easily when gently pierced with a fork. Meanwhile, gently warm the reserved chorizo oil in a small saucepan or skillet.7. To serve, spoon equal amounts of the stew into the middle of warm pasta bowls or serving plates. Arrange a halibut fillet on top and garnish with the scallions and cilantro. Drizzle 1 teaspoon of the flavored chorizo oil around each fillet.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To prepare the seasoning, combine the coriander, Old Bay seasoning, salt, and pepper in a bowl and set aside (if not using immediately, transfer to an airtight container and store in a cool, dry space).","ingredients":[{"id":1052034,"name":"old bay seasoning","image":"seasoning.png"},{"id":1042027,"name":"seasoning","image":"seasoning.png"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","image":"pepper.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"To prepare the stew, pour 2 tablespoons of the olive oil into a saute pan and set over medium-high heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the chorizo and saute for 2 to 3 minutes, until it begins to brown.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a mixing bowl.

Line the outside of a 9-inch springform pan with a sheet of 18 by 18 heavy duty aluminum foil (make sure the foil has no holes, you don't want any water to leak in). Add graham crackers and sugar to a mixing bowl and stir to combine, then pour in butter and mix with a fork until evenly moistened. Pour into prepared springform pan and press evenly into bottom. Bake in preheated oven 10 minutes, then remove and cool on a wire rack.For the filling:Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees. Have a large roasting pan ready and boil about 4 quarts of water (you may not need all of it). In a mixing bowl using an electric hand mixer blend together cream cheese, sugar and seeds of 2 vanilla beans just until smooth (scrape down side and bottom of bowl occasionally throughout entire mixing process). Mix in eggs one at a time, mixing just until combined after each addition. Add sour cream and heavy cream and mix just until combined. Tap bowl forcefully against countertop about 30 times to release any large air bubbles. Pour over cooled graham cracker crust and smooth into an even layer. Place cheesecake in roasting pan then place roasting pan in oven and carefully pour in enough boiling water to reach halfway up the side of the cheesecake pan. Bake in preheated oven until cheesecake is set but still jiggly in the center, about 65 minutes, then leave in oven and leaved door closed and let rest 10 minutes. Then remove from oven and cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Tent with foil and chill in refrigerator 8 hours or overnight. For the mousse:Melt white chocolate in a microwave safe boll on 50% power in 30 second increments, stirring between intervals, until melted and smooth (or alternately melt in a double boiler). Set aside and let cool until just lukewarm. In a mixing bowl using an electric hand mixer whip heavy cream until soft peaks form then add sugar and whip until stiff peaks form (the cream should get to the point where it's starting to lose that wet sheen and it should become quite thick. Tap excess cream of beater blades), set aside. In a separate mixing bowl whip cream cheese with seeds of vanilla bean until smooth. Mix in white chocolate (it may appear slightly gritty, that's fine). Add in half of the whipped cream mixture and fold with a rubber spatula until nearly combined, then add remaining half of the whipped cream mixture and fold until combined and no streaks remain. Pour over cold cheesecake and spread into an even layer. Tent pan with foil then return to refrigerator and chill 1 1/2 hours. For the whipped topping:In a mixing bowl whip heavy cream with seeds of 1/2 a vanilla bean if using until soft peaks form. Add sugar and whip until stiff peaks form. Run a knife around edges of cheesecake then spread whipped cream over mousse layer within 2 hours of serving. To serve remove foil from pan, pull latch and remove springform pan ring. Garnish with raspberries and mint if desired, cut into slices.Recipe source: Cooking Classy","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the crust:Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
