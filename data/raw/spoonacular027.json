Heat a large saute pan or skillet over medium-high heat and toast the shredded coconut until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes. Watch carefully and stir often to get even color. Remove to a plate and set aside. 2. In a small saucepan over medium heat, cook 1 tablespoon of coconut oil and dates, stirring occasionally, until the dates melt into a caramel-like consistency, about 5 minutes. 3. Stir in the coconut milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and the toasted shredded coconut. Cook until the mixture comes together and thickens slightly, about 3-5 minutes. 4. Place a 5-by-13-in [12-by-33-cm] piece of parchment paper on the counter with the long edge facing you. Pour the date-caramel mixture onto the left side of the parchment, about 1 in [2.5 cm] from the edge. Using a spatula, flatten and spread the caramel until it makes a 4-by-4-in [10-by-10-cm] square, about 1 in [2.5 cm] thick. Fold the right side of parchment paper over the caramel square. Place on a cookie sheet or flat plate and put in the freezer to harden for at least 1 hour. 5. Put the chocolate chips, remaining 2 tablespoons coconut oil, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon vanilla in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir constantly until the chocolate melts, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. (You can also melt the chocolate in the microwave, heating for 30 seconds, stirring, and repeating another one or two times until melted.) 6. Cut the date caramel into 1-in [2.5-cm] squares. Use a spoon or your fingers to dip the caramels into the melted chocolate, and then return them to the parchment paper. Sprinkle the tops with the ginger candy. Place the dipped caramels back into the freezer for at least 30 minutes before serving. 7. Store in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 1 month. Reserve any leftover chocolate in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week and reheat for more dipping fun. Variation: For those that dont need to watch their sodium strictly, sprinkle sea salt on top of the caramels while the chocolate is hardening.

The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.This wine has a broad range of food pairings, whether alone with some well chosen cheeses, richer fish preparations or a good old steak on the barbeque.","price":"$42.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438099-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":8,"score":0.8400000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fdutton-goldfield-dutton-ranch-pinot-noir-2014%2F154141"}]},"instructions":"Procedures                                                                              1                                                                            Bring 2 inches of water to a boil in the bottom of the double boiler. Place the butter, liqueur, and chocolate in the top of the double boiler (off the heat). Turn off the heat, then set the chocolate over the steaming water.

You can also use a hand mixer and a medium bowl, though you may need to beat the mixture a little longer to achieve the same results. Scrape the melted chocolate mixture into the eggs and whip until blended, about 1 minute.

Add the flour mixture to the egg mixture and beat on low speed just until combined. Stir gently a few times with the spatula to make sure there are no patches of unincorporated flour or butter lurking near the bottom of the bowl. Cover the dough with plastic and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours, until firm.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Preheat the oven to 325°F and position an oven rack in the center.

Place the remaining 1/2 cup of granulated sugar in one small bowl and the confectioners' sugar in the other. Roll each dough ball in the granulated sugar and then in the confectioners' sugar. Be sure to coat the dough generously with the confectioners' sugar—in this instance, more is better. Space the cookies about 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.                                                                                                                             6                                                                            Bake the cookies one sheet at a time, rotating the sheet halfway through the baking time, for 11 to 14 minutes, until the cookies are puffed and cracked.

Traditional techniques, including native yeasts, extended maceration, aging in French oak barrels and bottling without filtration, enhanced the wine's complexity. This wine is delicious with many entrees and cheeses. One of our favorite food pairings is roast turkey with a wild mushroom and walnut stuffing. Roast leg of lamb, rubbed with fragrant herbs and spices, or grilled pork loin also marry perfectly with the wine's luscious flavors.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438573-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.7473684210526317,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Frobert-mondavi-napa-merlot-1999%2F51817"}]},"instructions":"In a heavy ovenproof pot, add enough oil to cover the bottom about ¼” (5 mm).Put some flour on a plate and dredge the short ribs (or your choice of meat) on all sides and shake off the excess.When the oil is hot, add the ribs/meat and brown on all sides – you may have to do this in batches so as not to crowd the pan and steam instead of sear.

These crisp white wines work well with shrimp prepared in a variety of ways, whether grilled, fried, or in garlic sauce. You could try Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio.

A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":5,"score":0.8175000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fattems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014%2F160114"}]},"instructions":"Heat
