for 30 seconds until warmed through and butter starts to melt. Whisk for about 30 seconds. If the butter melts into the milk, it's warm enough. If it doesn't, microwave for another 10-15 seconds until it does.Sprinkle the yeast over the warm milk. Sprinkle the sugar over the yeast. If the sugar and yeast don't fall under the surface, swirl gently until they are submerged in the milk/butter mixture. Let sit until foamy.Add the flour, pumpkin pie spice, and salt into the bowl of a stand mixer.Add the yeasty liquid, the pumpkin puree, and the egg into the dry ingredients and mix with the bread hook attachment. Use a rubber spatula to scrape down the edges as needed.Once a dough ball has formed in the center of the bowl on the bread hook, continue to knead on the hook for 5 more minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest in a warm place until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.Once risen, punch down the dough and roll out to about 1 inch on a well floured surface. Use a donut cutter (or simply large and small round cookie cutters, like I did) to cut out donuts. Cover loosely with a cloth and let rise while heating the oil for frying.Heat oil in a 2 quart (or medium) saucepan over medium heat for about 10 minute. Test the oil by sprinkling a few water droplets into the pan. If the oil bubbles a little, it's ready. If it boils a LOT and starts splattering, take it off the heat for 2-3 minutes, lower the heat a notch or two, and then put it back on for frying. Prepare a stack of paper towels. This is for absorbing some excess oil from the fried biscuits. I usually set my stack of towels on a wire cooling rack. Place the donuts, one at a time, into the hot oil. Let it fry for 1-2 minutes on each side until golden brown.Let it sit on the paper towels for a minute to absorb some of the excess oil and cool before glazing and/or frosting.Whisk together the confectioners sugar, milk, and vanilla until smooth. Add more milk (by the teaspoon) if you want the glaze to be thinner.

For the herb-bacon oil: Combine the olive oil and herbs in a bowl.                          Heat the canola oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat, add the bacon and cook until crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Reserve the bacon pan drippings. Add the bacon to the herb oil, season with salt and pepper, and set aside.                          For the hash: Heat the bacon drippings in the cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook about 30 seconds.                          Meanwhile, toss the sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts and turkey in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Increase the heat to medium-high.Add the potato mixture, stir once to incorporate the onion and garlic, and then press firmly with a spatula against the bottom of the pan. Cook, pressing occasionally, until the bottom is browned and crispy, about 4 minutes, reducing the heat if the mixture starts to get too dark. (If the mixture seems dry, add some butter around the edges.)                          Once the bottom is browned and crispy, flip the hash in chunks and press again to brown some of the top side.                          For the poached eggs: While the hash is cooking, bring about 4 inches of water to a simmer in a deep skillet. Add the vinegar. Break each egg into a separate ramekin. Slip the eggs into the water and cook until the whites are set and the yolks still runny, about 4 minutes.                          Right before the eggs are done, divide the hash among 4 or 6 plates. Remove each egg with a slotted spoon, blot it dry on a clean side towel, and put it on top of the hash.

Pour the batter into the prepared baking sheet, and spread out until you have an even layer.Bake in the preheated oven for 13-15 minutes, or until the cake bounces back when gently pressed.Remove from oven and, using a sifter, immediately sift the additional confectioners’ sugar over the cake, until the entire cake is covered. This will help to prevent the cake from sticking when you roll it up.Place a lint-free, thin kitchen towel over the cake, making sure that the cake is covered, and one edge lines up with the 10-inch side of the cake. Place a cooling rack on top of the cloth, and carefully flip the baking pan upside down, turning the cake onto the cooling rack.Carefully remove the parchment paper from the bottom of the cake and, starting on the 10-inch side, roll the cake into a log. Be sure to roll the cloth along with the cake, that will ensure that you can unroll it later to put the filling in. Allow the cake to cool for about 1 hour.Beat together the softened cream cheese and butter until smooth. Add the confectioners’ sugar and vanilla. Beat until smooth again.Unroll the pumpkin cake, and spread the cream cheese filling over the cake, leaving 1-inch clear at the 10-inch side that will be the outside of the roll.Roll up the cake again, this time without the cloth. I like to roll the cake up in the lint-free towel again, just to help hold it’s shape. Wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours before serving. The Pumpkin Roll Cake can be made one or two days in advance.Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before serving to allow the filling to soften slightly.

In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish.

Add the tomatoes and their juices, sugar, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally and breaking up the tomatoes with a wooden spoon. Season to taste with salt and pepper.        Meanwhile, on a large plate, toss the breadcrumbs, Parmigiano, herbs, 1/4 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper.    Season the fish with salt and pepper. Beat the egg in a wide, shallow dish. Dip each fillet in the egg and then the breadcrumb mixture, pressing it on to help it adhere.    In a 12-inch heavy-duty nonstick skillet, heat the remaining 4 Tbs. olive oil over medium-high heat. Add two of the fillets and cook until the coating is nicely browned and the flesh is opaque and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Use a slotted spatula to move the fish. Repeat with the remaining fillets. Serve the tilapia with a spoonful of the sauce.

In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish.

After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. One wine you could try is Robert Mondavi Napa Merlot. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 30 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":438573,"title":"Robert Mondavi Napa Merlot","description":"The wine's multi-dimensional flavors come from grapes grown in distinctly different terroirs of Napa Valley, including the Carneros, Stags Leap and Oakville districts. Traditional techniques, including native yeasts, extended maceration, aging in French oak barrels and bottling without filtration, enhanced the wine's complexity. This wine is delicious with many entrees and cheeses. One of our favorite food pairings is roast turkey with a wild mushroom and walnut stuffing. Roast leg of lamb, rubbed with fragrant herbs and spices, or grilled pork loin also marry perfectly with the wine's luscious flavors.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438573-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":25,"score":0.7868421052631579,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Frobert-mondavi-napa-merlot-1999%2F51817"}]},"instructions":"Place the steak in a large ziplock bag or baking dish along with all the marinade ingredient.

Place a baking rack or ovenproof cooling rack on top of the foil, and brush or spray liberally with oil.  (The rack allows the air to circulate, really helping to dry out the skin on both sides of the wings.  If you do not have a rack, grease the foil and turn the wings halfway through the cooking time.)\nPlace half of the wings in a large zip-top bag. Sprinkle with half of the spice rub and shake until coated evenly. Place the wings on the prepared baking rack so they are not touching. Add the remaining wings to the bag, sprinkle with the rest of the spice rub, shake to evenly coat, and place on the baking rack. If you have an over-sized bag, you could coat all the wings at one time. (Tip: For crispiest skin, refrigerate the wings once theyve been placed on the rack, uncovered, overnight if possible or at least several hours.)\nWhen ready to cook, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Bake the wings in the upper middle portion of the oven for 45-50 minutes. (If the wings are cooked but you would like them to be a little browner, move the oven rack approximately 6 to 8 inches from broiler and briefly broil. Flip the wings and broil the other side.  Watch very closely so the wings dont burn.  The need for this will vary based on oven and personal preference. I like to broil just the side that has been face down on the baking sheet for a minute or two.)\nIf using the first or second (Traditional or Sticky Honey Buffalo) sauce: Immediately after removing the wings from the oven, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. (Tip: to keep the sauce from becoming too thick, do not simmer it until you are about ready to pour it over the cooked wings.) Add the remaining sauce ingredients and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to low and cook until slightly thickened, stirring often, approximately 3-4 minutes.

Add the warm water and gently stir. Let sit until yeast has doubled and is puffed and foamy on top, about 10 minutes.To the bowl add the melted butter, warm milk, greek yogurt and eggs, stir to combine. Add in the flour and knead the dough with the dough hook until the dough is smooth and forms a ball, about 5 minutes. Remove the dough from the bowl and oil the boil or use cooking spray. Place the dough back in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm area for about 1 hour or until doubled in size. While the dough rises make the butterscotch sauce. Melt the butter in a small sauce pot. Add the brown sugar, heavy cream and salt. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to medium. Boil for 5-10 minutes, until the sauce has thickened and coats the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and stir in the scotch and set aside. If the sauce gets too thick add in a splash of cream to thin. When the dough is ready and doubled in size spray 2 muffins tins with cooking spray. Flour your workspace and roll the dough with a rolling pin until it’s thin and somewhat rectangular (about 9x24 inches), then brush with melted butter (you may not use all the butter) and generously cover with 2 teaspoons cinnamon and 1 cup light brown sugar. Ok, this is when would be best to add chocolate chips if you choose :)  Now drizzle on about 1/4 cup of the butterscotch sauce. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Next roll up the dough. Starting with the end away from you, roll the dough into a line towards you. Slice the rolls into 18 to 24 slices and place them in the prepared muffin cups. I made 18 rolls, but they were BIG and popping out of the pan. Cover and let the rolls rise for about 15-20 minutes. Once the oven is hot place the muffin tins on two baking sheets and bake for 30 minutes. While the buns are baking add the pecans to a skillet set over medium heat and toast for 5-8 minutes or until toasted. Add two tablespoons scotch (or vanilla) and 1/3 cup of the butterscotch sauce, stir and remove from the heat. After 30 minutes grab the buns out of the oven and drizzle the pecans over the buns. Return the pans to the oven and bake another 10-15 minutes or until the tops are golden brown. Remove from the oven and let sit 5 minutes.Combine the salt and vanilla bean seed in a small bowl. Use your fingers to ingrain the seeds into the salt. Use a knife to carefully pop the buns out of the tins, they are going to be very sticky! If desired drizzle with more butterscotch sauce and then lightly sprinkle with vanilla salt.

d'oeuvre"],"diets":["lacto ovo vegetarian"],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"Warm milk until it is warm to the touch, but not hot. Stir in yeast and set aside until bubbles form, between 5 and 10 minutes.Sift together pastry flour, all-purpose flour, sea salt and sugar. Add to yeast and milk along with softened butter and warm water.Mix together with wooden spoon until all ingredients are incorporated. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface.Knead lightly for five minutes. Place dough in well oiled bowl, cover with towel and set in a warm draft free place to rise.While dough is rising, place three sticks of butter between two pieces of parchment paper.Using a rolling pin, pound out butter until it forms a 9x9 inch square. Place flattened butter, still between parchment in the fridge.Let dough rise for at least 90 minutes, as long as it takes for dough to double in size. Once doubled in size, punch down the dough, removing any air bubbles.Cover bowl with plastic and place dough in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. You can leave it longer, but if you do, you will need to punch to dough down again before you work with it.Remove dough from the fridge and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Shape dough into a rectangle using your fingers.Roll dough out to a rectangle that measures approximately 18x9.5 inches.Remove butter from the refrigerator and gently peel it off the parchment paper. Run a sharp knife between the butter and paper to loosen under stubborn spots. Place butter square in the middle of the rolled out dough.Encase the butter in the dough by folding each end of the dough into the middle of the butter.Seal the dough by crimping the edges, including where the two ends meet in the middle of the butter.Trim the excess dough from the top and bottom edges, getting as close to the butter without cutting into it.Working quickly, roll the dough out to a long rectangle, measuring approximately 16x9 inches.Now you are going to complete the first “double turn” You will be doing 3 double turns all together. Find the center of your rolled out rectangle. Bring the two long ends to the center of the dough.To complete the double turn fold the dough as if you were closing a book with the spine being where your two ends meet in the center. This completes one double turn. Wrap the folded dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour.Remove the dough from the refrigerator and repeat steps 15, 16, 17 and 18 twice more, completing two more double turns. Make sure that you allow the dough to rest in the fridge for at least an hour between each turn. This help keeps the butter intact. After the final turn, wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate overnight.The next day, prepare two cookie sheets by lining with parchment paper. Lightly flour a large rollout surface and remove dough from fridge.Roll the cold dough into a long rectangle that measures approximately 32x8 inches. Dough should be about 1/8 of an inch thick.Using a ruler, on one long end of the dough, mark every four inches.One he opposite long end, make your first mark at two inches and then every four inches after that.To cut the dough into triangles, use your ruler as a guide and cut from notch to notch on opposite sides of the rectangle. You will have a total of 16 triangles when you’re done.To form croissants, start by cutting a small notch in the long end of each triangle. And roll each triangle, starting with the long, notched end.Once rolled, put a slight bend in the dough, forming a croissant crescent shape. Arrange the 16 formed croissant onto the two baking sheets.Cover both sheets lightly with plastic wrap and let croissants rise in a warm, draft-free place for about an hour. Croissants will rise, but may not actually double in size, which is fine. What you’re looking for is the layers to be just beginning to pull away from each other and looked “puffed up” when you view the croissants from the side.Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and whole egg. Use a pastry brush to entirely coat the croissants with egg mixture.Once the oven has preheated, drop the temperature down to 350 degrees and immediately place croissants in the oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes, turning the cookie sheets halfway through to ensure even cooking. Croissants will have nearly doubled and size and have a golden brown color on the outside when done.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Warm milk until it is warm to the touch, but not hot.

Remove the salmon from the grill, allow to cool a few minutes and then remove the skin from the salmon and cut into four equal pieces.While the salmon cools make the salsa.

Try pairing with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir. After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. You could try Director's Merlot. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 21 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428445,"title":"Director's Merlot","description":"Our 2014 Director's Merlot offers lushness and a round, full palate. Its fragrance demonstrates red and black fruit with hints of anise and spiced wood. Juicy upon entry, the wine broadens and becomes velvety on the palate with flavors of plum, loganberry and black cherry accentuated by subtle spice notes of espresso bean and toasted vanilla. Medium tannins support the body of this wine, offering sophistication in its finish. Pairs nicely with brisket, grilled pork chops and linguine with pesto.","price":"$21.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428445-312x231.jpg","averageRating":1,"ratingCount":1,"score":0.75,"link":"https://www.amazon.com/2014-Directors-Merlot-750-mL/dp/B073XVS4MB?tag=spoonacular-20"}]},"instructions":"Combine all marinade ingredients, except steak, in a large resealable plastic bag.
