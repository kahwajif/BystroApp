Grill the sausages and bacon long enough to colour them but taking care not to dry them out. Drain on paper towels and chop the bacon into 2 1/2cm (1in) pieces. You can chop the sausages into bite-sized pieces, though some prefer to leave them whole.                                                                            4.

Place the covered pot in preheated oven and cook for at least three hours (up to four or five hours will not hurt it). After two hours, check liquid levels and add more water if necessary. There should be about an inch of liquid at the bottom of the pot at all times.                                                                            7.

Reduce heat slightly and allow to boil 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat, set aside.For the chicken:Brush both sides of chicken with 1 1/2 Tbsp of the olive oil and season pepper (you won't need salt since the teriyaki sauce is plenty salty). Preheat a grill over medium-high heat (to about 425 - 450 degrees). Brush grill grates lightly with oil then grill chicken until center registers 160 - 165 degrees on an instant read thermometer, about 4 minutes per side. Remove and let rest 5 minutes then dice into cubes.For the veggies:Heat remaining 2 Tbsp olive oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add zucchini, broccoli and carrots and saute 4 - 5 minutes until crisp tender.To assemble bowls:Layer rice into 4 bowls then top each with 1/4 of the chicken and 1/4 of the veggies.

In a medium bowl, set aside two cups worth of peanut butter mixture for the buckeyes and reserve the rest for the pie filling.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            To shape the buckeyes, scoop slightly less than a tablespoon of peanut butter mixture and roll into a ball. Place balls on parchment lined baking sheet pricking each with a toothpick. Place peanut butter balls in the freeze for approximately 30 minutes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            While peanut butter balls are in the freezer, mix together the reserved peanut butter filling with Neufchâtel (or cream cheese) and peanut butter in the bowl of a stand mixer until well combined. Slowly add in heavy cream and mix on medium high until well combined. Mixture will be lighter and fluffier. Scoop mixture into cooled chocolate graham cracker crust and refrigerate until set, 2 to 3 hours or overnight.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            In a double boiler, or microwave safe glass bowl, melt chocolate until smooth. If using the microwave, heat on high for 30 seconds then stir, then repeat in 10 second increments until smooth. Let chocolate cool slightly. Remove chilled peanut butter balls from freezer and dip and swirl in chocolate using the toothpicks being careful to leave a circle of exposed peanut butter on top. Return buckeyes to parchment lined baking sheet to set. When you've finished dipping the buckeyes, remove the toothpicks and use them to smooth over the hole. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or until completely set. Once buckeyes are set, place 10 evenly spaced buckeyes on top of the chilled pie. Cover and refrigerate any leftovers.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350°F.

C). Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned but still soft. Reserve the bacon grease in the skillet, and cool the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Once cool, mix the bacon together with the feta cheese, 3 tablespoons of sour cream, oregano, and black pepper in a small bowl; set aside.                            Lay a chicken breast flat onto your work surface. Use the tip of a sharp boning or paring knife to cut a 2-inch pocket in the chicken breast. Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts. Spoon the bacon mixture into the pockets. Pour the flour, egg, and bread crumbs into separate, shallow dishes. Gently press the chicken breasts into the flour to coat. Dip each into the beaten egg, then press into bread crumbs.                            Reheat the bacon grease over medium heat. Brown the chicken breasts on both sides in the hot fat, about 2 minutes per side. Reserve the bacon grease in the pan. Place the breasts on a baking dish, and bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink and the filling is hot, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).                            Meanwhile, place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.                            While the potatoes are boiling, cook the onion in the remaining bacon grease over medium heat until very tender and golden brown, about 10 minutes. Once the potatoes are done, mash together with the onion, butter, and remaining 3 tablespoons of sour cream.

Line 12 standard muffin cups with paper liners.In a small bowl, stir together the graham-style crumbs, 2 Tbsp sugar and melted butter. Place about 1 Tablespoon into each of the 12 muffin cups. With your fingers, pat it down to cover the bottom of the cup (you should have a little bit leftover to sprinkle on top fo the cupcakes). Sprinkle about 1 teaspoon of the mini chocolate chips over the cookie crust. Bake in the preheated oven for about 5 minutes, or until lightly browned around the edges. Remove from oven while you prepare the cupcake batter.In a large mixing bowl, stir together the brown rice flour, tapioca starch, millet (or sorghum) flour, xanthan gum, sugar, cocoa powder, espresso powder, baking powder and baking soda until well blended. Set aside.In a smaller mixing bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, oil, vanilla and eggs.Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and stir until blended.Spoon the batter into the paper cupcake liners, on top of the graham-style crust. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of the mini chocolate chips, and the remaining cookie crumb mixture.Bake in preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cupcake comes out clean. Remove from oven and allow to sit for 5 minutes before removing from the pan to a cooling rack. Allow to cool completely before frosting.Place the egg whites, sugar and cream of tartar in the heatproof bowl of an electric mixer. Set over a saucepan with simmering water in it, and whisk constantly until the sugar is dissolved and the whites are warm to the touch (about 3-4 minutes).Transfer the bowl to your stand mixer, fitted with a whisk attachment. Starting slow, and gradually increase the speed, beat until stiff, glossy peaks form (about 5-7 minutes). Add vanilla and mix until incorporated. Use immediately.Frost the Marshmallow Frosting onto your cupcakes using piping bag fitted with a large tip (or just the coupling), or snip the corner off a resealable bag. Place the cupcakes on a cookie sheet, and use a small kitchen torch, carefully toast the frosting until it is a light brown colour. Be sure to keep the torch moving, as it browns really fast. Also, be sure to keep the flame from the torch away from the paper cupcake liners.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

dish"],"diets":["gluten free","dairy free","lacto ovo vegetarian","whole 30","vegan"],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"Sort the black beans, discarding any stones or damaged beans.Wash the black beans in a colander and then, soak them in three times their volume of cold water for at least 4 hours or best, overnight (12 hours or more) so they will become more tender and cook faster. Rinse and drain them. Reserve.Cook the black beans: In a large, heavy-bottom pan over medium-high heat, bring the black beans with 6 cups of water and 1 tablespoon of oil to a boil. Oil reduces foaming during the cooking process! Then, cover the pan and reduce heat. Let simmer over low heat for 60 to 90 minutes or until almost tender. Remove from heat and reserve, covered.If cooking black beans in a pressure cooker (something very common in Brazil), make sure the pot is no more than half full of ingredients, including water. Soaked beans may be cooked in about 20 minutes while unsoaked beans generally take 25 to 30 minutes and so to cook depending on how old the beans are. The truth is the older the beans, the more cooking time required.In a separate pan, heat the oil over medium heat and cook the diced onion until translucent, stirring occasionally. Next, add the garlic and cook for about 30 to 60 seconds, stirring occasionally.Mix the cooked onion and garlic into the cooked black beans. Add the bay leaves, and stir in all the seasonings, spices, and the vinegar (While vinegar improves taste and reduces gassy elements, it should be added near the end of the cooking time because it may toughen the skins). Add ½ to 1 cup of water more, only if necessary. Cover and let simmer over medium-low heat for additional 15 minutes or until tender (If black beans were cooked in a pressure cooker, add those ingredients and let simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, uncovered). Stir and remove the bay leaves. If desired, remove about 1 cup of cooked black beans (grains and broth) and blend in a blender until smooth. Add back to the cooked beans and stir. This will make the beans thicker and tastier. Right before serving, sprinkle the chopped cilantro or parsley if desired.Black beans can be served with white rice (a staple in Brazil) and your favorite meat, or used as a base for black bean soup and dips.STORAGE: Let cooked black beans cool and refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5 days, or freeze them for up to 3 months.Cate o feijão, descartando todas as pedras, impurezas ou grãos danificados.Lave o feijão em um escorredor e, em seguida, ponha de molho em três vezes o seu volume de água fria durante pelo menos 4 horas ou melhor, durante a noite (12 horas ou mais ) para que o feijão fique macio e cozinhe mais rápido. Lave e escorra o feijão. Reserve.Cozinhe o feijão: Em uma panela grande, sobre fogo médio-alto, junte o feijão, 6 xícaras de (chá) de água e 1 colher de (sopa) de óleo ou azeite e deixe levantar fervura (O óleo ou azeite reduz a formação de espuma durante o processo de cozimento). Em seguida, tampe a panela e reduza o fogo, deixando cozinhar sobre fogo baixo por cerca de 60 a 90 minutos ou até que esteja quase macio ou cozido (Se o feijão preto for cozinhado em uma panela de pressão, certifique que a panela não esteja mais do que a metade cheia de ingredientes, incluindo água. Em geral, leva cerca de 20 minutos para o feijão cozinhar se houver sido posto de molho durante a noite, enquanto que o feijão que não ficou de molho leva cerca de mais de 25 a 30 minutos para cozinhar, dependendo de quão velho seus grãos são . A verdade é que quanto mais velho o feijão, mais tempo leva para cozinhar). Retire do fogo e reserve, tampado.Em uma outra panela, aqueça 1 colher de (sopa) de óleo ou azeite sobre fogo médio e cozinhe a cebola picada até ficar translúcida, mexendo ocasionalmente. Em seguida, adicione o alho e cozinhe por cerca de 30 a 60 segundos, mexendo ocasionalmente.Misture a cebola cozida e alho ao feijão cozido. Adicione as folhas de louro, e misture todos os temperos, especiarias e vinagre ( vinagre melhora o sabor e reduz os gases ou flatulência, mas deve ser adicionado perto do final do tempo de cozimento pois pode endurecer o feijão). Adicione ½ a 1 xícara de (chá) de água, somente se necessário. Tampe o feijão e deixe cozinhar sobre fogo médio-baixo por mais 15 minutos ou até ficar macio (Se o feijão foi cozinhado em panela de pressão, adicione esses ingredientes e deixe cozinhar por mais 5 a 10 minutos, destampado). Mexa e retire as folhas de louro. Se quiser, reserve cerca de 1 xícara de (chá) de feijão cozido e passe no liquidificador. Ponha de volta na panela e misture. Isso fará o feijão ficar mais grossinho. Pouco antes de servir, adicione o coentro ou salsa picada, se desejar.Feijão preto pode ser servido com arroz branco e sua carne favorita, ou usado como uma base para sopa de feijão.ARMAZENAMENTO: Deixe o feijão preto cozido esfriar e leve à geladeira em um recipiente hermético por até 5 dias, ou congele por até 3 meses.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Sort the black beans, discarding any stones or damaged beans.Wash the black beans in a colander and then, soak them in three times their volume of cold water for at least 4 hours or best, overnight (12 hours or more) so they will become more tender and cook faster.

This will make the beans thicker and tastier. Right before serving, sprinkle the chopped cilantro or parsley if desired.Black beans can be served with white rice (a staple in Brazil) and your favorite meat, or used as a base for black bean soup and dips.STORAGE","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Let cooked black beans cool and refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5 days, or freeze them for up to 3 months.Cate o feijão, descartando todas as pedras, impurezas ou grãos danificados.Lave o feijão em um escorredor e, em seguida, ponha de molho em três vezes o seu volume de água fria durante pelo menos 4 horas ou melhor, durante a noite (12 horas ou mais ) para que o feijão fique macio e cozinhe mais rápido. Lave e escorra o feijão. Reserve.Cozinhe o feijão: Em uma panela grande, sobre fogo médio-alto, junte o feijão, 6 xícaras de (chá) de água e 1 colher de (sopa) de óleo ou azeite e deixe levantar fervura (O óleo ou azeite reduz a formação de espuma durante o processo de cozimento). Em seguida, tampe a panela e reduza o fogo, deixando cozinhar sobre fogo baixo por cerca de 60 a 90 minutos ou até que esteja quase macio ou cozido (Se o feijão preto for cozinhado em uma panela de pressão, certifique que a panela não esteja mais do que a metade cheia de ingredientes, incluindo água. Em geral, leva cerca de 20 minutos para o feijão cozinhar se houver sido posto de molho durante a noite, enquanto que o feijão que não ficou de molho leva cerca de mais de 25 a 30 minutos para cozinhar, dependendo de quão velho seus grãos são . A verdade é que quanto mais velho o feijão, mais tempo leva para cozinhar). Retire do fogo e reserve, tampado.Em uma outra panela, aqueça 1 colher de (sopa) de óleo ou azeite sobre fogo médio e cozinhe a cebola picada até ficar translúcida, mexendo ocasionalmente. Em seguida, adicione o alho e cozinhe por cerca de 30 a 60 segundos, mexendo ocasionalmente.Misture a cebola cozida e alho ao feijão cozido. Adicione as folhas de louro, e misture todos os temperos, especiarias e vinagre ( vinagre melhora o sabor e reduz os gases ou flatulência, mas deve ser adicionado perto do final do tempo de cozimento pois pode endurecer o feijão). Adicione ½ a 1 xícara de (chá) de água, somente se necessário. Tampe o feijão e deixe cozinhar sobre fogo médio-baixo por mais 15 minutos ou até ficar macio (Se o feijão foi cozinhado em panela de pressão, adicione esses ingredientes e deixe cozinhar por mais 5 a 10 minutos, destampado). Mexa e retire as folhas de louro. Se quiser, reserve cerca de 1 xícara de (chá) de feijão cozido e passe no liquidificador. Ponha de volta na panela e misture. Isso fará o feijão ficar mais grossinho. Pouco antes de servir, adicione o coentro ou salsa picada, se desejar.Feijão preto pode ser servido com arroz branco e sua carne favorita, ou usado como uma base para sopa de feijão.ARMAZENAMENTO: Deixe o feijão preto cozido esfriar e leve à geladeira em um recipiente hermético por até 5 dias, ou congele por até 3 meses.","ingredients":[{"id":6164,"name":"salsa","image":"salsa.png"}],"equipment":[]}]}]},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":16,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"sourceUrl":"http://www.mycolombianrecipes.com/tortilla-de-platano-maduro-ripe-plantain-frittata","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/tortilla-de-pltano-maduro-ripe-plantain-frittata-227296","aggregateLikes":105,"spoonacularScore":48,"healthScore":5,"creditsText":"My Colombian Recipes","sourceName":"My Colombian Recipes","pricePerServing":172.28,"extendedIngredients":[{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"egg.png","consitency":"solid","name":"eggs","original":"6 large eggs","originalString":"6 large eggs","originalName":"eggs","amount":6,"unit":"large","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":6,"unitShort":"large","unitLong":"larges"},"metric":{"amount":6,"unitShort":"large","unitLong":"larges"}}},{"id":19296,"aisle":"Nut butters, Jams, and Honey;Health Foods","image":"honey.png","consitency":"liquid","name":"honey","original":"3 tablespoons honey","originalString":"3 tablespoons honey","originalName":"honey","amount":3,"unit":"tablespoons","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":3,"unitShort":"Tbsps","unitLong":"Tbsps"},"metric":{"amount":3,"unitShort":"Tbsps","unitLong":"Tbsps"}}},{"id":9277,"aisle":"Produce","image":"plantains.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"plantains","original":"3 very ripe plantains, peeled and diced","originalString":"3 very ripe plantains, peeled and diced","originalName":"very ripe plantains, peeled and diced","amount":3,"unit":"","meta":["diced","very ripe","peeled"],"metaInformation":["diced","very ripe","peeled"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":3,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""},"metric":{"amount":3,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""}}},{"id":1188,"aisle":"Canned and Jarred","image":"cheez-whiz.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"queso dip","original":"2 cups grated queso fresco or queso blanco, plus more for garnish","originalString":"2 cups grated queso fresco or queso blanco, plus more for garnish","originalName":"grated queso fresco or queso blanco, plus more for garnish","amount":2,"unit":"cups","meta":["grated","plus more for garnish"],"metaInformation":["grated","plus more for garnish"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":2,"unitShort":"cups","unitLong":"cups"},"metric":{"amount":473.176,"unitShort":"ml","unitLong":"milliliters"}}},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png","consitency":"solid","name":"sugar","original":"1 tablespoon sugar","originalString":"1 tablespoon sugar","originalName":"sugar","amount":1,"unit":"tablespoon","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsp"},"metric":{"amount":1,"unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsp"}}},{"id":4513,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg","consitency":"liquid","name":"vegetable oil","original":"2 tablespoons vegetable oil","originalString":"2 tablespoons vegetable oil","originalName":"vegetable oil","amount":2,"unit":"tablespoons","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":2,"unitShort":"Tbsps","unitLong":"Tbsps"},"metric":{"amount":2,"unitShort":"Tbsps","unitLong":"Tbsps"}}}],"id":227296,"title":"Tortilla de Plátano Maduro (Ripe Plantain Frittata)","readyInMinutes":45,"servings":6,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/227296-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"dishTypes":["lunch","main course","main dish","dinner"],"diets":["gluten free","dairy free"],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"Heat oven to 350 degrees F.In a nonstick fry pan over medium heat, warm the oil.

Set up a bowl of well-salted ice water. Cook the broccoli rabe in the boiling water for 1 to 2 minutes and then immediately plunge in the salted ice water. This will prevent the broccoli rabe from being overcooked and will set the lovely green color.                          Drain the broccoli rabe and squeeze out any excess water; coarsely chop. Place the broccoli rabe in the bowl of a food processor and puree until it is a coarse paste. Add the pistachios and parmigiano and puree until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning; you probably will need more salt. Add the ricotta and pulse until combined. Taste for seasoning once again-it should be full-flavored, slightly bitter and creamy at the same time. Set aside.                          Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil.
