This wine is made with grapes from its vineyards in the heart of Tuscany's Chianti Classico region and is a blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot grapes. The additional aging time required to be a Riserva produces softer tannins and a more mature finish.\n\nThe color is deep and dense ruby red, with aromas of very ripe black cherries and plums, then floral hints of gladiolus.

Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a large non-stick frying pan and cook the aubergine in 3 batches, adding 1 tbsp oil for each batch. They should be softened and lightly golden.\nAdd the remaining oil to the pan and cook the onions for 5 mins until softened. Stir in the garlic, cook for 1 min more, then return the aubergine to the pan with the tomatoes, tomato pure, sugar and chilli flakes.

really well with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. You could try Talbott Sleepy Hollow Chardonnay ().

Sleepy Hollow consistently produces Chardonnay with intense tropical fruit character, which exhibits both richness and finesse. Sleepy Hollow Chardonnay is considered by many as one of the quality standards for California Chardonnay. Vineyard Manager and Winemaker Sam Balderas keeps yields low to increase concentration and minimizes the handling of the wine to preserve the fruit's natural essence. This wine is 100% barrel fermented in French Oak and aged on the yeast lees to impart a rich, toasty, complex character to the wine. \n\nTasting Notes for this Vintage\nConcentrated rich flavors of tropical fruit marry with mineral elements and French oak accents. A typically high level of acid produces a long, clean finish. Our signature Chardonnay, this wine can be cellared up to nine years and improves with age. Showing super lush now.","price":"$34.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/436621-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":5,"score":0.7975,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Ftalbott-sleepy-hollow-chardonnay-2001%2F83056"}]},"instructions":"Meanwhile,heat oven to 375 degrees.

Chenin Blanc, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Scallops. Chardonnay and chenin blanc are great matches for grilled or seared scallops. If your scallops are being matched with bacon or other cured meats, try a lightly chilled pinot noir.

The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.\n\nQuintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

Combine all the ingredients except the ground Kashmiri chiles in a medium-size bowl, and stir to coat with the oil.2. Preheat a medium-size skillet over medium heat. Pour the oiled spices into the skillet and roast the blend, stirring constantly 3 to 4 minutes.3. Immediately transfer the spices to a plate to cool. Once they are cool to the touch, place half of the spices in a spice or coffee grinder and grind until the texture resembles that of finely ground black pepper. Pour the ground mixture into the same medium-size bowl and grind the remaining half. Combine. Stir in the ground Kashmiri chiles.4. Store in a tightly sealed jar, away from excess light, heat, and humidity for up to 2 months.Make the sea scallops5. Combine the scallops with the turmeric in a medium-size bowl. Refrigerate, covered, for 30 minutes or as long as overnight, to allow the flavor to permeate the thick muscle (since there is nothing acidic to break down the mollusks texture, its fine to marinate them overnight).6. Pour the peanuts into the bowl of a food processor and pulse until they have the consistency of coarse breadcrumbs.7. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the scallops, marinade and all (there wont be much at the bottom of the bowl), arranging them in a single layer. Sear the scallops two broad sides until light brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer them to a plate.8. Add the garlic to the same skillet and stir-fry until it is light brown, about 1 minute. Pile in the spinach leaves, cover the skillet, and cook until the spinach is wilted, 5 to 8 minutes. (As the steam rises from within, the leaves will sweat and release their liquid, which will deglaze the pan and build yet another layer of flavor.) Stir in the masala and salt.9. Add the scallops (including any liquid pooled in the plate), and cover them with a blanket of the wilted greens. Cover and cook, without stirring, until the scallops are firm to the touch but not rubbery, 3 to 5 minutes.10. Transfer the scallops to a serving platter. Add the peanuts to the spinach in the skillet, and stir to combine. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, to allow the nuts to absorb the excess liquid and thicken the sauce, 2 to 4 minutes.11.

Roll puff pastry out between 2 pieces of parchment paper until thin. It should increase in size by a good 50%. Cut into 2 rectangles. You can leave them rectangle shape or take a knife and round the corners off to make 2 ovals.Place the 2 pieces of dough on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Make sure they do not touch each other. Use 2 baking sheets if you have to.Completely cover the dough with another piece of parchment paper and place a second baking sheet on top.

The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.\nThis wine has a broad range of food pairings, whether alone with some well chosen cheeses, richer fish preparations or a good old steak on the barbeque.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438099-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":8,"score":0.82,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fdutton-goldfield-dutton-ranch-pinot-noir-2014%2F154141"}]},"instructions":"Combine sour cream, cream cheese and taco seasoning in a medium bowl until smooth.

Cook until sugar and salt dissolve. Remove from heat and pour in remaining quart of water. Cool to room temperature.    Place pork chops in a one gallon plastic bag or non-reactive bowl. Carefully pour cooled brine over the pork chops. Seal or cover. If you're using a bag place the bag into a bowl just in case there are any leaks. Refrigerate for 4 hours but no more then 6.    When ready to cook, preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Grease the aluminum foil lightly with olive oil or cooking spray.    Remove pork chops from the brine and rinse.    Pulse the potato chips and garlic together in a food processor until the chips are crumbs. You want about 2 cups.    Place the flour on a plate. In a bowl whisk together egg and milk. Place potato chip crumbs onto another plate.    Dredge the brined pork chops in the flour. Then dip into the egg/milk mixture. Then press into the potato chips to coat completely.    Place pork chops onto prepared baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes. Turn and bake for 15 more minutes or until cooked through. Turn on the broiler for 2 - 3 minutes to crisp up the coating. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat 1 quart water in a pot over medium heat with kosher salt, brown sugar and cajun seasoning.

and spices. Set aside.In another separate bowl, whisk together the milk, pumpkin puree, vanilla, melted butter, and egg yolks (place egg whites in a seperate bowl or stand mixer bowl).Add pumpkin mixture to dry ingredients, folding with a spatula gently, until just combined. Set aside.Meanwhile, using a hand-mixer or stand mixer (with whisk attachment), whisk egg whites over low speed until foamy. Increase speed to medium-high and whisk until egg whites are stiff (peaks will hold) but still wet. **Note: Although it is not essential that the egg whites be room temperature when you start this step, it will make the process easier and much more effective.Gently fold egg whites, in two separate additions, into the pumpkin batter.Heat a tab of butter in large non-stick skillet over medium heat.

egg, coconut extract, and beat on medium-high speed until creamed and well combined, about 4 minutes. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the flour, pudding mix, baking soda, optional salt, and beat on low speed until just combined, about 1 minute. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the Mounds Bars, chocolate chunks, and beat on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds. Using a large cookie scoop, 1/4-cup measure, or your hands, form approximately 13 equal-sized mounds of dough, roll into balls, and flatten slightly. Tip - Strategically place a few Mounds Bars and chocolate chunks right on top of each mound of dough by taking pieces from the underside and adding them on top. Place mounds on a large plate or tray, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, up to 5 days. Do not bake with unchilled dough because cookies will bake thinner, flatter, and be more prone to spreading. Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with a Silpat or spray with cooking spray. Place dough mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (I bake 8 cookies per sheet) and bake for about 11 to 12 minutes (bake less if you made smaller-sized cookies than recipe indicates), or until edges have set and tops are just set, even if slightly undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center; don't overbake. Cookies firm up as they cool. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for about 10 minutes before serving. I let them cool on the baking sheet and don't use a rack. Cookies will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months. Alternatively, unbaked cookie dough can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 4 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.

Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Cook the pasta: Heat 4 quarts of water and 2 Tbsp salt in a large pot for the pasta. Once the water starts to boil, add the pasta and cook at a rolling boil, uncovered, until al dente, cooked through, but still a little firm to the bite (the low end of the cooking times given on the package). Drain, reserving 1 cup of the pasta cooking water.\n\nHeat butter, add garlic, add ham and peas: While you are cooking the pasta, heat the butter in a medium skillet on medium heat until melted.
