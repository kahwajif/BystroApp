make the crust: Add the flour to a large mixing bowl or to the bowl of a food processor. Add the cream cheese, salt, and buttermilk powder if using. Use a pastry blender or a fork to cut the cream cheese into the flour until crumbly. If using a food processor pulse a few times until crumbly.Dice the cold butter up and work it into the flour with the pastry blender/fork until crumbles the size of dimes form or pulse in the food processor until crumbly.Sprinkle the dough with the cold water a tablespoon at a time and toss - squeeze the dough with your hands after each addition - if it holds together don't add more water. If it doesn't stick together keep adding the water a tablespoon at a time until the dough sticks togetherDivide the dough into 2 pieces, flatten each one into a disk, wrap with saran wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes. Cover a large baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper and spray lightly with non-stick baking spray.On a floured surface roll one of the disks out into a 10\" circle and use a sharp knife to trim the edges (I put a 10\" dinner plate over top to trim the excess). Place on baking sheet. Roll out the remaining disk the same way. In a small bowl whisk the egg with a tablespoon of water. Assembling the pie requires that you work fast because as soon as you toss the berries with the other ingredients they will start letting go of their juices making it hard to get the pie together as the juice starts running everywhere. Make sure your crusts and egg are prepped and ready to go before mixing the cherries.In a large mixing bowl toss cherries with the sugar, lemon, vanilla and cornstarch. Immediately spread out - evenly - over top of the crust on the baking sheet leaving about an inch border around the edges. Dot the top with butter.Brush the edges with the beaten egg and also brush the edges of the top crust.Place the top crust over the cherries and press together the edges with your fingers all the way around then use a fork to crimp the edges together.Brush the entire pie with the egg and poke a few slits in the top to allow steam to escape. If you have extra dough cut cookie cutter shapes and adhere them to the top with the egg, brush the tops of them too.Refrigerate the pie for 30-60 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Bake pie 15 minutes then turn heat down to 350. Bake about 18-20 minutes longer until pie is golden brown around the edges. Remove from oven and cool. Once cool whisk the butter and confectioners' sugar together in a small bowl adding a teaspoon or two of milk to make a glaze. Brush generously over entire pie, then repeat if you have some left. Sprinkle with coarse sugar.

Add ghee and essential oil and stir until well combined. Place the chocolate in the refrigerator to firm up, about 30 minutes or so. Using a small ice cream scoop (about the size of a melon baller), scoop out little balls of the chocolate mixture and place them onto a baking sheet that’s been lined with parchment paper, then shape those into perfect little spheres by rolling them between the palms of your hands. Put these in the fridge to chill while you work on the chocolate coating. Melt the cacao paste in the microwave in 20-30 second intervals and stir well for an equal amount of time between each interval until it’s completely melted. When the chocolate is fully melted, add the honey, coconut oil and pinch of salt and stir delicately until smooth.Remove the truffles from the baking sheet and set a fine meshed cooling tray right over that parchment paper. Dip the truffles one by one in the melted chocolate and place them on the tray to drip. Put them back in the fridge to set for 10-15 minutes then dip them a second time. Place them in the fridge once more until completely set. If you have a little bit of melted chocolate left, drizzle it over your finished truffles to make cute a little design. When your truffles are completely set, drop them in a bowl full of cacao powder, move them around a little bit to completely cover them and then take them out.

Spread the vegetable slices out onto a kitchen towel or layers of paper towels and sprinkle them lightly with kosher salt. Let stand for 15 minutes to allow some of the excess liquid to drain off. Pat dry. Prepare the zucchini according to one of the three methods below:GRILL METHOD: Preheat an outdoor grill or indoor grill pan to medium. Lightly coat with canola oil, then grill the eggplant and zucchini strips until cooked and lightly brown, about 2-3 minutes per side.BROIL METHOD: Place the top oven rack about 5 inches from the upper heat element. Set the oven to broil at 500 degrees F.Arrange the zucchini and eggplant slices in a single layer on a baking sheet. (Do not line the baking sheet pans with wax paper or parchment, as they will burn.) Lightly brush the slices with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Flip over the slices and repeat for the other side. Broil for 8 minutes, or until lightly brown, working in multiple batches as needed. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly. Place the slices on paper towels to remove excess moisture.NEITHER: Move ahead with the recipeSkip grilling or broiling the zucchini completely. The lasagna will have a lot of excess liquid around the veggie slices in the slow cooker (even after salting them in step 1), but if this doesn't bother you, you can scoop out the noodles and discard it.Lightly coat a 6-quart crock potwith cooking spray.

Recover, turn off the slow cooker, and let stand until any remainingliquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes to 1 hour (note: if you did not grill or broil the vegetables first, you will have a lot of remaining liquid).To serve, slice and scoop desired portions, then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and herbs as desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"With a mandolin or very sharp knife, slice the eggplant and zucchini length-wise into long, thin (1/4-inch) sections so that they resemble lasagna noodles.","ingredients":[{"id":11209,"name":"eggplant","image":"eggplant.png"},{"id":11477,"name":"zucchini","image":"zucchini.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404745,"name":"knife","image":"chefs-knife.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Spread the vegetable slices out onto a kitchen towel or layers of paper towels and sprinkle them lightly with kosher salt.","ingredients":[{"id":1082047,"name":"kosher salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":221439,"name":"kitchen towels","image":"dish-towel.jpg"},{"id":405895,"name":"paper towels","image":"paper-towels.jpg"}]}]},{"name":"Let stand for 15 minutes to allow some of the excess liquid to drain off.

Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper; that way the cauliflower won’t stick. Place the cauliflower on the sheet and drizzle the oil over it. Spray it with nonstick cooking spray and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Toss it with your hands to make sure everything is salted. Spread the cauliflower in a single layer and bake for 10 minutes, then flip it with a spatula. You don’t have to flip each and every one, so don’t get OCD about it. Bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, until lightly browned, tender, and toasty.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            In the meantime, crumble the tofu into a mixing bowl. Use your hands to mash the tofu, squeezing it between your fingers, until it has the consistency of ricotta cheese. Add the nutritional yeast, lemon juice, pepper, and remaining salt. Use a fork to mix well.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            When the cauliflower is done, transfer it to the mixing bowl with the tofu mixture. Use a potato masher to mash it really well, for a minute or so. If it doesn’t seem to be mashing enough with the potato masher, a few pulses in the food processor should get it nice and crumbly. Set aside.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            To prepare the sauce, mix all its ingredients together and set aside.                                                                                                                             5                                                                            Preheat the oven to 350°F.

cupcake tins with liners. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl and set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together at medium-high speed for 3-4 minutes, or until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition, and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Combine the buttermilk, lime zest and juice, vanilla and 2 tablespoons of the tequila in a 2 cup measuring cup. With the mixer on low speed, alternately add the dry and wet ingredients in 2-3 batches, starting and ending with the flour. Mix until just incorporated. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared tins. Bake for 18-24 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few crumbs and the top springs back when touched lightly. Cool the cupcakes in the tins for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and brush the tops with the remaining ¼ cup tequila and cool completely before frosting.  To make the frosting, puree the strawberries in a food processor and set aside. Combine the egg whites, sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer set over a small saucepan of simmering water. Whisk constantly by hand until the sugar has dissolved. Test by rubbing the mixture between your fingers; you shouldn't feel any grittiness.Attach the bowl to the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Begin mixing on low speed and gradually increase to high and whip until stiff peaks form. Continue mixing until the mixture is completely cool (test by feeling the bottom of the bowl) and light, fluffy and glossy. This should take about 10 minutes but may take longer.Replace the whisk attachment with the paddle attachment. Set the mixer to medium-low and add the butter, 2 tablespoons at a time, mixing well between each addition. Once all the butter has been incorporated, increase to medium speed and beat until fluffy.

Use a little bit of flour to keep it from sticking. Spread 2 Tablespoons melted butter on top of the rectangle.In a small bowl stir together the filling ingredients. Spoon the filling mixture over the butter. Leave about a 1/2 inch around the edge. Carefully roll the dough into a log from the shortest side up. If the dough sticks, use a knife or spatula to gently loosen as you roll it up. Cut the log into 9 even pieces. You can also cut a small piece off either end to even it out.Grease an 8x8 baking dish with 1 Tablespoon melted butter. Place the 9 rolls in the pan.

Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 425F.    In a medium bowl, combine the panko, butter, parsley, and lemon zest. Add a pinch of salt and a grind of pepper and stir to evenly distribute the ingredients.    Line a heavy-duty rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Arrange the cod fillets on the baking sheet and season all over with salt and pepper. Divide the panko topping among the fillets, pressing lightly so it adheres. Roast until the breadcrumbs are browned and the fish is mostly opaque (just cooked through), with a trace of translucence in the center (cut into a piece to check), 10 to 12 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets.

Add butter, and continue pulsing 10 or 12 more times until the mixture is crumbly and coarse, with various-sized but obvious chunks of butter scattered throughout.Place two ice cubes, broken up if necessary into the feed tube of the food processor. With machine running, pour up to  cup cold water through the ice filled feed tube a tablespoon at a time until dough just comes together and begins to pull cleanly away from the sides of the bowl in jagged clumps. Dont let the machine run too long and dont worry if you dont use all the water. Overworked dough and/or too much water are the main culprits in pastry that is tough or dense. However, in warm weather or dry climates you may need up to an additional 2 tablespoons more cold water. Divide dough in half, shape into 2 discs, one about 6-inches in diameter and 3/4-inch thick, the other about 4-inches in diameter and 3/4-inch thick. Wrap in plastic. Refrigerate least 1 hour (or up to 2 days), or freeze up to 1 month. Place oven rack in center position. Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Use a lightly floured surface and a lightly floured rolling pin to roll out the larger disc of chilled dough to about a 13-inch round, a generous 1/8-inch thick. Carefully fold dough in half, and slide it onto rolling pin. Transfer to a 9-inch deep dish, or a 10-inch standard pie pan. Unfold the dough, easing it gently into pan; do not stretch dough. Fold excess dough back forming a raised lip, crimp the edge decoratively as you like. Place the pan into the refrigerator to chill at least 10 minutes.Roll the second disc of dough out into as large a 1/8-inch thick round as possible. Use a cookie cutter of your choice to cut out as many shapes as possible. Re-roll the scraps if you like to get a few more.  Place the cutouts onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Place the sheet in the refrigerator to chill at least 10 minutes.Place the dried cranberries into a small heatproof bowl, pour hot water over the berries; set aside.Toss together pears, fresh cranberries, brown sugar, cornstarch, vanilla, orange zest, cardamom, cinnamon, allspice, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Drain the dried cranberries well, then stir them into the bowl too.Remove the lined pie pan and the pastry cutouts from the refrigerator. Sprinkle the nuts evenly across the bottom of the lined pie pan. Scrape the pear and cranberry mixture, including any accumulated liquid, into the lined pie pan. Spread the mixture evenly, compacting it slightly with the back of a spoon to assure a well packed pie. Place the pastry cutouts decoratively on top of the pie, using the egg wash as glue. Then brush all the exposed pastry with the remaining egg wash. Sprinkle the top of pie with turbinado sugar.Place the pie on a rimmed parchment lined baking sheet and place it into the heated oven. Bake 90 to 100 minutes, or until the pie is well browned and bubbling aggressively.Remove from oven and allow to cool at least 90 minutes before slicing.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a blade attachment pulse flour and 1 teaspoon salt 5 or 6 times until well combined.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"food-processor.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add butter, and continue pulsing 10 or 12 more times until the mixture is crumbly and coarse, with various-sized but obvious chunks of butter scattered throughout.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Place two ice cubes, broken up if necessary into the feed tube of the food processor.

the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter the bottoms and sides of two 9-inch round cake pans; dust with flour, and tap out the excess.                          Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.                          Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, making sure the batter is well mixed before adding the next egg. Beat in the vanilla until blended.                          Alternate folding the flour mixture and the milk into the butter mixture with a spatula, adding the flour in three additions and the milk in two, starting and ending with the flour, until just smooth. (The batter may look slightly curdled as you mix it, but this is not a problem.) Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.                          Bake until the cakes are golden and the centers spring back to the touch, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool in the pans about 10 minutes, turn out onto cooling racks and let cool completely. Turn the cakes over, and poke the tops all over with the tines of a fork. Generously brush the tops with the liqueur, letting it soak in before brushing on more.                          For the frosting: While the cakes cool, bring a few inches of water to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Set a large heatproof bowl over it (do not let the bowl touch the water), add the egg whites and sugar and whisk until the mixture is warm and the sugar has dissolved, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pan, and beat the mixture with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until stiff, glossy peaks form, 4 to 7 minutes. Beat in the butter a few pieces at a time, and continue beating until the frosting is smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. (Don't worry if the mixture becomes soupy or looks separated; keep beating and it will come together.) Stir the Kahlua and instant coffee together until dissolved, and beat into the frosting with the mixer running on low speed. Increase the speed to medium-high, and beat until fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes.                          To assemble: Place 1 cake layer right-side up on a cake plate or stand, and spread with 1 cup of the frosting. Top with the second cake layer. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Try pairing with Chianti, Trebbiano, and Verdicchio. Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. One wine you could try is Fonterutoli Chianti Classico.

Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8073684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Ffonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998%2F12434"}]},"instructions":"Watch how to make this recipe.

Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Add the steaks and sear until well browned, about 4 minutes. Flip the steaks and add the butter, garlic and rosemary. Using a spoon, continually baste the top of the steaks with the butter. Cook until medium to medium rare, about 6 more minutes. Set aside loosely covered with foil and let rest 10 minutes before slicing.                          For the Gorgonzola mousse: Blend together the Neufchatel and Gorgonzola until well combined. Using a hand mixer, beat the heavy cream to medium peaks. Fold in the cheese mixture until uniform. Season with salt and pepper.                          For the crostini: Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat.                          Drizzle some olive oil over both sides of the baguette slices and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toast the slices on the grill pan until light golden on both sides, a few minutes per side.                          To build the crostini, thinly slice the rested steaks against the grain and layer onto the crostini, about 4 slices per crostini. Place a dollop of the Gorgonzola mousse on top (or pipe for a fancier presentation), followed by some Caramelized Bourbon Shallots, Marinated Radishes and microgreens. Top with a piece of shrimp on a tiny skewer or toothpick, tail up.                          Melt the butter in a pan over medium heat. Add the shallots and slowly sweat and caramelize for 15 to 20 minutes. Deglaze with the bourbon, cooking about a minute, then season with salt and pepper.

Drain, reserving 2 cups of the soaking liquid. Roughly chop the porcini.                          Heat 1 tablespoon each butter and olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add half of the button and shiitake mushrooms and cook, undisturbed, until slightly browned on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring, until soft, 2 to 3 more minutes; transfer to a bowl. Repeat with another 1 tablespoon each butter and olive oil and the remaining button and shiitake mushrooms. Transfer to the bowl and add 1/2 teaspoon salt.                          Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 1 tablespoon each butter and olive oil to the skillet. Add the onion and porcini and cook, stirring, until the onion is soft, about 4 minutes. Stir in the garlic and red pepper flakes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until darkened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the reserved 2 cups porcini liquid, the crushed tomatoes, button and shiitake mushrooms and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the parsley; season with salt.                          Prepare the lasagna: Bring 7 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan; transfer to a large heatproof bowl. Meanwhile, bring 3 cups water to a boil in a separate large saucepan. Gradually whisk the polenta and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt into the bowl of hot water. Cover the bowl tightly with foil and set over the saucepan of boiling water. Reduce the heat so the water is simmering; cook the polenta until the liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, uncover and vigorously whisk in the parmesan, eggs and nutmeg.                          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly brush a 3-quart baking dish with olive oil. Spread one-third of the polenta in the dish and top with half of the mushroom sauce. Sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella. Repeat the layers (polenta, sauce, mozzarella), then top with the remaining polenta. (If the polenta gets too thick, whisk in a little hot water.)                          Loosely cover the dish with foil and bake until bubbly, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Turn on the broiler. Uncover the lasagna and top with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella; broil until melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley. Let stand 15 minutes before serving.

Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":436696,"title":"Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio","description":"Light green lustres run through the radiant straw-yellow color of this wine, whose aroma is rich in fruits, the most striking of which are pears and apples.

To make the Quick Pickled Vegetables: Combine vinegar, sugar and salt in a saucepan with the water; bring to a boil over high heat and stir to dissolve sugar. Add carrots, onions, and jalapeños, and reduce heat to medium-high. Simmer until carrots are just tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Pour into a bowl; let cool completely before covering and refrigerating. (Pickles will keep up to 2 weeks. Recipe makes 1 quart.)2. Stir together cumin, oregano, chili powder, and 2 teaspoons salt. Mix in the olive oil and cilantro. Use a sharp knife to make shallow slits about 1½ inches apart into the fish skin; transfer to a large dish and rub both sides with spice mixture. Refrigerate, covered, for 30 minutes to 2 hours.3. Toss together cabbage and 1½ teaspoons salt in a medium bowl. Let sit 30 minutes.4. Heat grill (or grill pan) to high (if using a charcoal grill, coals are ready when you can hold your hand 5 inches above grill for just 2 to 3 seconds); lightly oil grates. Place fish, skin side up, on grill. Cook, without moving fish, until opaque throughout, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip, using two spatulas if necessary. Cook until fish flakes slightly when pressed in the center, 5 to 7 minutes more.5. Transfer fish to a serving platter; let cool slightly, then shred with a fork into bite-size pieces. Garnish platter with lime wedges and cilantro sprigs. Serve warm or at room temperature (within 1 hour). Allow guests to assemble their own tacos, layering fish with cabbage, avocado, sour cream, hot sauce, pickled vegetables, and other toppings, as desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"To make the Quick Pickled Vegetables","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine vinegar, sugar and salt in a saucepan with the water; bring to a boil over high heat and stir to dissolve sugar.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add carrots, onions, and jalapeños, and reduce heat to medium-high.
