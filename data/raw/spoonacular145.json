Gently break apart the walnuts into bite sized pieces (leaving a few big pieces). Mix together with melted butter and salt, and spread into an even layer on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until nuts are fragrant and beginning to turn golden in color. Remove from oven and allow to cool completely.For the Maple Ice Cream: In a small dish, whisk together 2 tablespoons of the milk and the cornstarch together and set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together cream cheese and salt until smooth. Fill a third (Large) bowl with ice and water. In a glass measuring cup with a spout, mix together the cream and corn syrup.Bring the Maple Syrup to a boil in a large saucepan over medium high heat.  Once to a full boil, reduce heat to medium and continue simmering for 8 minutes, or until it has reduced by half and begins to darken around the edges. Remove from heat and whisk in the cream/corn syrup mixture, stirring constantly. Next add the remaining milk and place back on heating element. Bring to a rolling boil and allow it to boil for 4 minutes (it may look somewhat curdled due to the acidity in the maple syrup, but it'll come back together when it is frozen). Remove from heat and whisk in the cornstarch slurry. Bring the mixture back to a boil and allow it to thicken slightly (1-2 minutes). Remove from heat and little by little, whisk the hot mixture into the cream cheese until smooth. Next, either pour the mixture into a gallon sized ziplock bag (or I like to use quart sized soup containers) and place into ice water to chill.

Beat in the egg, milk, and vanilla extract, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Once mixed, add the food coloring and beat until combined. Turn the mixer off and pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Turn the mixer on low and slowly beat until a very soft dough is formed. Beat in more food coloring if you'd like the dough to be redder. The dough will be sticky.Cover the dough tightly with aluminum foil or plastic wrap and chill for at least 1 hour. Chilling is mandatory.Preheat oven to 350F degrees. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.Scoop 1.5 Tablespoons of dough and mold into a ball, as pictured above. Place 9 balls onto each baking sheet. Bake each batch for 10 minutes. The cookies may have only spread slightly, that is ok. Simply press down on the warm cookies if you'd like them spread out more. Allow to cool for at least 25 minutes on the baking sheets before dipping.In a small microwave safe bowl, melt the white chocolate in 15 second increments, stirring after each time until perfectly smooth. White chocolate seizes very quickly, so be careful. Dip half of each cookie into white chocolate and top with sprinkles, as pictured above.Allow the chocolate to set.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Core the pineapple and cut into 3cm chunks.

Heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted into the oil reaches 375 degrees F.                          Place the chickpeas, flour, cumin, salt, turmeric, chile flakes, coriander, garlic, onions, cilantro and parsley in a food processor, and pulse until ground down to a coarse cornmeal consistency. Chill for 10 minutes in the fridge.                          Once chilled, scoop about 2 ounce balls of the falafel mix, and roll in the sesame seeds. Fry the balls, no more than 5 at a time, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Set the falafels on a paper-towel-lined sheet pan or plate as they come out of the oil to drain.                          For the mousse: Dissolve the gelatin in 1 tablespoon water. Combine the heavy cream, feta and garlic in a sauce pot and heat until the feta slightly melts, 2 minutes. Pull off the heat and stir in the gelatin and olive oil. Then place in a blender and blend until very smooth. Scoop the mixture into a shallow bowl or container and season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate or blast chill, and set aside.                          For the pita: Preheat the oven to 550 degrees F. In a medium bowl, combine 2 cups warm water, the flour, sugar and yeast. Cover and let it rise in a warm place for 10 minutes.                          Place the honey, olive oil, salt and dough mixture into a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Beat until the dough is soft, 10 minutes. Turn the dough onto a floured cutting board and cut into 4 to 8 pieces. Roll the pieces into round dough balls, and then flatten using your hands or a rolling pin to 1/2-inch thick and 4- to 6-inch round. Place the dough rounds onto an oil-greased sheet tray and bake until the dough is cooked, 2 to 4 minutes.                          To serve, layer the mousse and falafel on top of the pita bread (taco-style), and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the falafels: Fill a large skillet halfway up the side with oil.","ingredients":[{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted into the oil reaches 375 degrees F.","ingredients":[{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404789,"name":"kitchen thermometer","image":"food-thermometer.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Place the chickpeas, flour, cumin, salt, turmeric, chile flakes, coriander, garlic, onions, cilantro and parsley in a food processor, and pulse until ground down to a coarse cornmeal consistency.

Pat the meat dry, then sprinkle with the flour mixture and toss to coat.                          Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a 4-quart Dutch oven (or oven-ready saucepan) over medium-high heat. When the oil shimmers, add half of the meat and sear until brown on all sides, about 5 to 6 minutes. Remove to a plate and repeat with the remaining meat.                          Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of the oil and reduce the heat to medium. Add the onions, carrots, and celery. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are brown, about 5 minutes.                          Heat oven to 325 degrees F and arrange a rack in the middle.                          Add the garlic, tomato paste, thyme, and bay leaf and stir to coat.

Top the stew with the biscuits and brush with a little cream. Return the pot to the oven bake until the tops are crispy and golden brown, about 30 to 35 minutes.
