Slowly whisk in the cream, making sure there are no lumps. Whisk in the egg yolks. It is important that this mixture be as smooth as you can make it.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Warm and flavor the milk: Whisk the milk with the sugar over medium heat in a 3-quart (2.8-L) saucepan. If you’re using the vanilla bean, scrape it and add the seeds to the pan. Whisk the mixture so the seeds are incorporated into the liquid. (It should look speckled, like milk after an Oreo has been dunked in it repeatedly!) When the vanilla bean has been scraped out, drop the entire pod into the pan as well. Warm until bubbles form around the edge of the milk and the entire surface begins to quiver. Remove the vanilla bean and discard it. Turn off the heat.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Temper the slurry: Pour all of the milk mixture into the slurry. Whisk vigorously to combine. The mixture should come together smoothly, with no lumps. Pour the mixture back into the pan. Thicken the pudding: Turn the heat back on to medium and bring to a simmer, whisking constantly and vigorously. Work all the angles of the pot, and scrape the bottom. It will take 2 to 5 minutes to bring the custard to a boil, with large bubbles that slowly pop up to the surface. Boil, whisking constantly, for 2 minutes. Turn off the heat. (If you didn’t use a vanilla bean, stir in the vanilla extract now.)                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Strain and chill the pudding: Pass the custard through a fine-mesh strainer. Pour it into eight 1/2-cup (120-ml) ovenproof ramekins and refrigerate. Do not cover them; in this case, you want a thin, dry skin to form on top. Chill the puddings for at least 4 hours, or overnight.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Brûlée the pudding! Lightly sprinkle the surface of each pudding with an even layer of turbinado sugar. Shake the ramekins from side to side to even out the layer. Use a kitchen torch to caramelize the sugar. Let sit 5 minutes before serving so the sugar layer can cool and harden.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Alternate method: Make sure your ramekins are broiler-safe. Move a rack up to the highest position and heat your broiler. Broil the ramekins for 3 to 7 minutes, until the sugar is evenly melted and browned.

olive oil. Mix with a spoon, then let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add in 2 1/2 cups flour and salt, stirring with a spoon until the dough comes together but it still sticky. Using your hands, form the dough into a ball and work in the additional 1/2 cup flour, kneading it on a floured surface for a few minutes. Rub the same bowl with olive oil then place the dough inside, turning to coat. Cover with a towel and place in a warm place to rise for about 1 1/2 hours.After the dough has risen, punch it down and place it back on the floured surface. Sometimes I work in a few more sprinkles of flour if the dough is sticky. This amount of dough yielded 2 pizza crusts for my 12-inch cast iron skillet. If you're using an 8-inch, you may get 3 doughs, but you also may just want to stick with 2 thicker doughs. Divide the dough evenly in half (or thirds). Place one dough on a well-floured pizza peel and roll into a round about the size of your skillet.pizza + the skillet methodHeat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Season the beef with the salt, pepper and onion powder, then add to the skillet and cook until browned, using a wooden spoon to bread the beef into small crumbles, about 5 to 6 minutes. Drain any liquid from the skillet. Combine the ketchup and mustard in a small bowl and mix until combined. Note that this sauce makes enough for two pizzas, so use half on each. Remember, the dough MUST be on a well-floured pizza peel (or surface) so you can simply slide the entire thing into the skillet. Spread half of the sauce onto the dough and cover it with a sprinkling of cheddar. Add half of the beef on top, then add another handful of cheese and the bacon. The bacon should only be slightly cooked so it doesn't burn in the oven. Place an oven rack directly under your broiler and preheat your broiler to the highest setting. Additionally, place your cast iron skillet on the stovetop burner, turning the heat on high. You want to heat the skillet for 10 minutes. If it begins to smoke a lot, you can reduce the heat a bit. But you want it HOT.Place a potholder or thick towel on the handle of the skillet (it will be sooo hot). Carefully slide the pizza into the skillet, dough side down. Don't worry if a few toppings or pieces of cheese slice onto the surface - it will be totally fine. After about 30 seconds, turn off the burner, grab the skillet and pop it in the oven, right under the broiler. Broil for 1 minute, then using the potholder, grab the handle and rotate 180 degrees, broiling for only 1 more minute. Remove immediately and place on the stovetop. Let cool slightly for about 5 minutes, then use a large spatula to remove the pizza.

Add the raspberry preserves and beat until thick and creamy, about 2 full minutes. Add more powdered sugar if frosting is too thin or looks too wet. Add more salt if the frosting is too sweet.Frost cooled cupcakes however you'd like. I filled a few of the cupcakes with some frosting before topping with more frosting. That's optional, but recommended. It gives the cupcakes more raspberry flavor! To fill the cupcakes: using a sharp knife, cut a circle/hole into the center of the cupcake to create a little pocket about 3/4 inch deep.

Combine egg whites, remaining sugar, and pinch of salt in the heatproof bowl of electric mixer, and place over saucepan. Whisk constantly until sugar is dissolved and whites are warm to the touch, 3 to 3 1/2 minutes. Test by rubbing between your fingers. Transfer bowl to electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, and whip, starting on low speed, gradually increasing to high until stiff, glossy peaks form, about 10 minutes. Pipe or swirl the meringue on the top of the cooled pie and place the pie under the broiler and watch if carefully, the top should brown but not burn, and it changes quickly. Chill for 10 minutes, sprinkle with zest, then serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pour the Key lime juice through a fine strainer into a small saucepan and set it over low heat.","ingredients":[{"id":9160,"name":"lime juice","image":"lime-juice.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"},{"id":405600,"name":"sieve","image":"strainer.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the crushed coriander seeds (do not use a grinder, or the powder will be too fine) and heat the liquid just until it starts to bubble at the edges.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Remove from heat.

Place the butternut squash on a large rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss squash to coat evenly and roast in preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, turning pan and rotating squash once or twice so it evenly browns. Remove from oven. Meanwhile, heat chicken or vegetable stock in a small sauce pan and bring to a simmer. Turn to low and keep stock warm.Over medium heat, add remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and butter to a large heavy bottomed stock pot. Add onion and saute 10-12 minutes until soft and golden. Add minced garlic and barley. Stir for 1 minute until garlic is fragrant and barley is glossy and coated in butter and oil. Turn the heat to medium-high and add white wine. Stir and let the wine evaporate. Use a lade and begin adding the stock about  cup at a time, stirring after each addition. When the stock is just about evaporated, add more. The barley shouldnt be soupy or dry. Play with the heat and keep it between medium and medium-high and stir frequently. Begin tasting the barley about 25 minutes after you initially add it. In the end you want the barley to be tender but still have a tiny bit of crunch; this could take as long as 35-40 minutes. You might use all the stock but might notkeep extra on hand just to be safe!

Whisk in the cream and milk and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, about 10 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and begins to bubble.                          Transfer the cream mixture to a heatproof bowl and add the mint. Set the bowl over a bowl of ice water to cool the mixture down quickly and stir occasionally until cool; discard the mint after 5 minutes. (Don't steep the mint for too long or it will impart a grassy flavor; a quick steep while the cream cools will do.) Cover the mint cream and refrigerate about 4 hours, or until completely cold.                          Freeze the mint cream in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions until frozen.                          Meanwhile, place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl, set it over a saucepan of simmering water and stir the chocolate until it has just melted. Remove from the heat and cool until the chocolate is barely warm and still fluid.                          Transfer the gelato to a large bowl set over a bowl of ice. Working quickly, drizzle the melted chocolate into the gelato while whisking or stirring vigorously. The chocolate will flake apart as it hits the cold gelato, forming bits of chocolate throughout. If you prefer larger pieces of chocolate throughout the gelato, use a wooden spoon to slowly stir in the melted chocolate. Serve immediately, or transfer to a container and freeze until firm, 3 to 4 hours.                          Curtis serves his homemade gelato between waffle cookies.

The sugar will begin to form clumps and will eventually melt and turn brown. Once the sugar has melted completely, add the butter. The mixture will bubble, continue stirring for 2 minutes or until the butter has completely melted, then add the cream. Boil for 1 minute then remove from the heat and add the salt. Allow the caramel to cool for 8-10 minutes before using.\nMeanwhile, Using a double boiler on the stovetop, (or a saucepan with a bowl set over it) add water and set over low heat. Pour chocolate in and stir continuously until the chocolate has melted. Remove from stove and using a pastry brush, spoon or your fingers, cover the bottom of the cupcake liners. You'll want a pretty good amount because generally the bottom has the most chocolate.\nRemove the cookie dough from the refrigerator and roll into balls, then pat flat. Place the flattened cookie dough into each cupcake liner. Then spoon the caramel sauce over top, making sure to leave enough room in the liner to add the top layer of chocolate.Pour the remaining chocolate over the top of the caramel. To create an even top gently shake the pan on a flat surface or tap.\nPlace the tin into the refrigerator to chill for 2 hours or until the bottoms of the cups are set. Eat cold or bring to room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Line two mini muffin/cupcake tins with 18 liners, set aside.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"In a small mixing bowl combine the melted butter, brown sugar, flour, and vanilla.

It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":432869,"title":"Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay","description":"The Napa Valley Reserve Chardonnay opens with toasty aromas of vanilla bean, baked pears and a hint of cantaloupe.

In a bowl, make the General Tso sauce: Whisk together the soy sauce, vinegar, honey, garlic chili sauce, chicken broth, just 1 teaspoon of the cornstarch. Set aside.2. In a wok or large sauté pan over high heat, add 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil. Add broccoli to the pan and cover. Steam for 2 minutes or until broccoli has turned bright green and is crunchy-tender (just shy of cooked through.) Remove broccoli from pan, drain and rinse with cool water to stop cooking. Set broccoli aside. Empty water from wok or pan and dry well. Return wok or pan to stove.3. In a medium bowl, add chicken, remaining 2 teaspoons of cornstarch, salt and pepper and stir to coat chicken evenly.4. Heat the wok over high heat. When very hot, add cooking oil and swirl to coat. To get a nice crust on the chicken, you'll cook them in a single layer, giving them plenty of space to brown. Add half the chicken to pan in a single layer. Let cook undisturbed for 1-2 minutes, until the bottom of chicken is browned, flip chicken, cook until other side is browned. The chicken should be halfway cooked through - removed the half-cooked chicken pieces to a plate to set aside.

Let the pan cool a bit before adding the rest of the ingredients (so they don't burn). The pan should still have some cooking oil left from the chicken. To the pan, add the green onions, garlic and ginger . Stir fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Control your heat so that the ingredients don't burn.6. Pour in the General Tso's sauce to pan and bring mixture to a simmer. Return the chicken and broccoli to the pan, toss and cook for 1 minute. The sauce should thicken and the chicken should be cooked through completely.
