In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour, sugar, and salt. Pulse to combine. Add shortening and butter. Pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal.

Dump the dough onto plastic, wrap it up, forming it into a disc. Refrigerate it for at least 1 hour and up to overnight.After the dough has chilled, divide it into 2 equal pieces.  On a lightly floured surface, roll half of the crust so it is large enough to fir your pie pan.  Press it into the pan.

Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":452761,"title":"Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio","description":"Pinot Grigio Ramato continues a tradition of the Republic of Venice, since “ramato”, or coppery, was the term referred to Pinot Grigio in contracts. A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":5,"score":0.8175000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fattems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014%2F160114"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                In a small bowl, combine the coleslaw mix, onion, pepper and 1/4 teaspoon seasoning.

                              For the Cake: Lightly coat two 9-inch round cake pans with baking spray. Line bottoms with parchment paper rounds and coat once again with baking spray. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F.                                                                                                                                2                                                                            Pulse 1 1/2 cups sugar and zest in food processor until no zest strands remain and sugar is damp and yellow.

Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar and continue whipping until stiff peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes longer. If you used the stand mixer bowl, transfer whites to separate bowl.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Beat butter and lemon sugar with paddle attachment on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add flour mixture in three additions, alternating with milk mixture. Fold in egg whites and divide batter equally between prepared pans.                                                                                                                             6                                                                            Bake until tester inserted in center of cakes comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer cakes to cooling racks and cool 10 minutes in pans. Turn cakes out directly onto racks, peel off and discard parchment, then invert so the tops are facing up. Cool completely, about 1 hour.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            For the Meyer Lemon Curd: Pulse the zest and sugar in food processor until no zest strands remain and sugar is damp and yellow.  Alternatively, rub the zest into the sugar with fingertips.                                                                                                                                8                                                                            Whisk the lemon sugar, cornstarch, eggs, egg yolks, and salt together in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add juice and cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until thickened and the consistency of pudding, 8 to 10 minutes. Once mixture reaches the boil, continue cooking and whisking for 2 minutes longer.                                                                                                                             9                                                                            Strain curd into medium bowl. Add butter and stir until completely incorporated. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the custard and refrigerate until completely chilled. Alternatively, place bowl in ice bath and stir constantly until custard is completely cooled, about 10 minutes.                                                                                                                            10                                                                            To Assemble: With a serrated knife, cut each cake in half to create 4 equal layers. Place one layer on a serving dish or cake stand and spread with one third (about 1/2 cup) of cooled curd. Repeat with remaining cake layers and curd.                                                                                                                            11                                                                            Sift confectioners’ sugar over cake.

The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.This wine has a broad range of food pairings, whether alone with some well chosen cheeses, richer fish preparations or a good old steak on the barbeque.","price":"$42.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438099-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":8,"score":0.8400000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fdutton-goldfield-dutton-ranch-pinot-noir-2014%2F154141"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
