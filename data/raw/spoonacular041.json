I thought it was hideous.HIDEOUS.but he wanted it, and was certain that somebody would buy it, even with the $120 price tag. It certainly wasn't worth arguing over, so I held my cringe as he happily \"zapped\" it with the registry gun.I don't remember which of our guests bought this platter, but I do know that this fish has been lovingly packed in bubble wrap each time we've moved, and we find every opportunity we can to bring it to the table. A platter of brownies? put 'em on the fish. Cheese and crackers? put 'em on the fish. How about strawberries and grapes? put 'em on the fish. It makes me smile every single time.The Ingredients.serves 2I took this picture prematurely. I ended up adding more ingredients than are pictured (I told you I was lousy at food photography!)2 salmon fillets (slightly frozen is okay)1 tablespoon butter, melted1/2 tablespoon lime juice1/8 teaspoon black pepper1/2 teaspoon dried minced parsley (if you have fresh, chop up 1-2 teaspoons)2 cloves minced garlicaluminum foilThe Directions.Use a 4-6 quart slow cooker. Spread a length of foil onto the countertop, and put the salmon fillets directly in the middle.In a small bowl, melt the butter in the microwave, then stir in lime juice, pepper, garlic, and parsley. Brush this mixture all over the top of your fish. Fold the foil over and crimp the sides to make a packet.Put this packet into the bottom of an empty slow cooker. Cover, and set to high for two hours.Your fish is finished when it flakes easily with a fork.Serve with steamed broccoli and quinoa (or something similar).on a fish plate.The Verdict.The salmon gets infused with a nice mild citrusy flavor---it's not too limey, and if I didn't know better, I'd probably think it's lemon. And yup, if you'd rather use up the lemons on your tree, go ahead and use them! It's all good.This was enough fish for me and Adam and the girls, but would really only fill up two adults. I'm pleased that there was enough flavor that no one at the table asked for tartar sauce!I hope you had a wonderful Labor Day weekend. I'm so happy to spend another fall crockpotting with you!Fish.
