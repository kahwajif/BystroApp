and Sauvignon Blanc. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. You could try Chehalem INOX Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442371,"title":"Chehalem INOX Chardonnay","description":"INOX® takes its name from the abbreviation of the French word for stainless steel, inoxydable. The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":5,"score":0.8175000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fattems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014%2F160114"}]},"instructions":"Place the shredded potato in a towel and squeeze as much of the liquid out as you can. Place in a rimmed dish and toss together with the parmesan and the chives. In a second dish, combine the flour, salt and pepper. In a third dish, whisk together 2 eggs. Preheat 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium high heat. When it's good and hot, dredge the tilapia into the flour mixture (being sure to thoroughly coat it) and shake off excess. Next, dunk into the egg wash. Last, place a thin layer (about 1/4\") of the shredded potato into the hot pan, trying to match the size of the fish filet as best as possible. Place dredged and egg washed fish on top of the potato \"bed\".Cook for about 4 minutes (should have a nice golden crust), and then lift fish with a spatula. While holding fish with the spatula, add the remaining butter and oil (if needed). Once it's good and hot, add another thin layer of the shredded potato mixture to the pan (again matching the size of your fish filet). Carefully flip the fish onto the new \"bed\" of shredded potato and allow to finish cooking (about 4-6 minutes depending on fish size). Once golden on both sides, remove from pan and allow to rest for 2 minutes before serving (allowing the heat to finish the last bit of cooking). Garnish with fresh lemon juice, chives, and parmesan cheese. DELICIOUS.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place the shredded potato in a towel and squeeze as much of the liquid out as you can.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Place in a rimmed dish and toss together with the parmesan and the chives.
