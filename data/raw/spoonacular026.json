If you do not have this functionality, start by heating a large heavy pot or French oven over medium-high heat. Sprinkle beef pieces fairly generously with salt. Add oil to the pan. When oil is hot and shimmery, add the beef pieces and brown so that each side has a beautiful browned crust to it. Remove beef to slow cooker and turn heat to the low setting. If you own a multicooker, turn heat to the brown/saut setting and let it heat up for a minute or two. Add oil. When oil is hot and shimmery, add the beef pieces and brown so that each side has a beautiful browned crust to it.To the slow cooker, add the coconut milk, curry paste, lime zest and juice, fish sauce, brown sugar, cumin, and red pepper flakes. Stir to combine. Then add onion, bell peppers, mushrooms, garlic, ginger, and black pepper. Stir to coat all of the veggies with the coconut milk mixture. Cover slow cooker and turn heat setting to high. Cook for 4 to 5 hours, or until beef is fork tender and falling apart. Remove beef to a cutting board and pull apart using two forks. Add beef back to the slow cooker. Serve over hot rice, with scallions, cilantro, and lime wedges on the side.Notes:Feel free to experiment with your favorite veggies in this dish. To mix it up, I also like to include more bell peppers, thinly sliced carrots, halved fresh pea pods, and minced fresh jalapeo. If you aren't fond of cilantro, try thinly sliced fresh basil, as Stephanie includes in her original braised recipe. Change it up to your family's taste buds...that's what great cooking is all about!For braising preparation instructions using a French oven, please visit theoriginal braised recipefrom Stephanie at fresh tart.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"I own a multicooker that allows me to both brown and slow cook in the same appliance.

top picks for Mexican. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. One wine you could try is Bernardus Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir. It has 4.7 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 48 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":465202,"title":"Bernardus Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir","description":"The Santa Lucia Highlands are known as one of the premier Pinot Noir appellations of the world. One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg.

Stop right here if you’re looking for a short-cut to ginger ale and you don’t want to mess around with the fermentation process. Pour three or four tablespoons (more or less depending upon how gingery you like it) of your syrup over ice and add 8 ounces of seltzer water or club soda.

Best stick with strips that are 3 1/2 to 4 inches long and no more than 1/2 inch or so wide.)3. Stir together the butter, vanilla, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves.4. Beat the egg whites and sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed for about 1 minute. Reduce the speed to low, add about half of the flour, and beat just until combined. Switch to a spatula and gently fold in the butter mixture. Add the remaining flour and fold just until combined.5.

Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for about 30 seconds and then, working quickly, transfer the cookies from the baking sheet and place them on a clean dish towel. Place a fortune just above the center of each cookie and fold the cookie in half, pinching the top of the curved portion to seal. Gently bend the ends of the fortune cookie together to form a fortune cookie shape. (Fold the cookie over a chopstick, if you have one, to help create the bend in the center.)

sage and peppercorns in a large pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. Transfer to a 16-quart pot, clean 5-gallon bucket or a brining bag. Add ice water. Submerge the turkey in the brine, breast-side down. Weight the turkey with a plate, if necessary, so it stays submerged. Refrigerate for 12 to 18 hours.To roast turkey: Remove all the oven racks except one, set in the lowest position; preheat oven to 475F.Remove the turkey from the brine and rinse well with cold water. Thoroughly dry with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. (Discard the brine.) Rub the turkey all over with oil and sprinkle with sea salt. Place on a roasting rack, breast-side up, in a roasting pan. Tuck the wing tips under the turkey and tie the legs together with kitchen string.Roast the turkey for 30 minutes, rotating the pan back to front halfway through. Remove from the oven and cover the whole turkey with a double layer of foil. Add 2 cups hot water to the roasting pan. Continue roasting, rotating the pan again halfway through, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh without touching bone registers 165F, 1 to 1 1/2 hours more. Peek under the foil 15 to 30 minutes before you think the turkey will be done; if its not browning nicely, remove the foil for the remainder of the roasting time.Carefully transfer the turkey to a large, clean cutting board; let it rest, loosely covered with foil, for at least 20 minutes before removing the string and carving.To prepare gravy: While the turkey is roasting, place potatoes in a large saucepan and add water to cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook until the potatoes are very tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain.While the turkey is resting, skim any visible fat from the pan drippings. Place the roasting pan over medium heat. Add broth (or stock) and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits. Transfer to a blender, add the potatoes and blend on high speed for 2 minutes. If the gravy is too thick, add a little broth (or stock or water) to thin to the desired consistency. Return the gravy to the pan and simmer over low heat until hot, about 2 minutes. Season with pepper.Carve the turkey and serve with the gravy.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"To brine turkey","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine vegetable broth, kosher salt, agave nectar, onions, thyme, sage and peppercorns in a large pot.

In a small bowl combine the sour cream, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla. On low speed gradually add the sour cream mixture into the dry ingredients. Beat on low until just combined, scraping down the edges as necessary. Add in the boiling water and beat until just combined. Be careful not to over-mix.Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean. Cool the cakes in their pans for 30 minutes before carefully turning them out onto a cooling rack. Freeze the cakes until very firm.For the ice cream:In the pitcher of a blender, puree all the ingredients until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl and press plastic wrap against the surface. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or up to 1 day.Pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer’s directions. Line a clean 8-inch cake pan with plastic wrap. Pour the ice cream into the cake pan then press another sheet of plastic wrap against the surface. Freeze until firm, about 2 hours or up to 2 days.For the ganache:Place the chocolate chips in a medium heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan heat the cream just until simmering. Pour over the chocolate chips. Let sit for 3 minutes before stirring until the mixture is melted and smooth. Let cool until the ganache is thickened but still pourable.To assemble:On a serving plate or cake stand, place 1 cake layer upside-down. Remove the ice cream from the pan and place over the cake, peeling off the plastic wrap. Top with the remaining cake layer. Pour the ganache over the cake, letting it drip down the sides.
