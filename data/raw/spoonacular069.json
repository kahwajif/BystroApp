Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"With a paring knife, puncture a tiny hole in each clove of garlic. Place cloves in a small pot and cover with the olive oil. If the cloves aren't completely covered, add a splash more oil. Bring to a boil. Turn down as low as the flame will go. Simmer until a paring knife slides in easily (about 15 to 20 minutes). Take off the heat and cool in the pan. Set aside.                                  Preheat oven to 250 F. Prepare your sheet pan. I use a full-size cookie sheet covered with a Silpat or parchment paper. But If you have a nice and clean nonstick sheet pan, there's no need to cover it. Place the whole tomatoes on the pan and toss with garlic oil (just scoop it right out of your garlic confit pot), salt, and herbs. Place in the preheated oven. Check after 1 1/2 hours to make sure they're not burning. Take them out of the oven when they've shriveled up and darkened in color. They should still be moist inside. This takes 2 to 3 hours. Remove form the oven and smoosh them with the back of a wooden spoon (careful, they will squirt you!) and cook them for another 15 minutes. Remove from the oven. Rub the herb sprigs between your hands, sprinkling the dried leaves down onto the tomatoes. Discard any tough sticks. Gently mix. Set aside.                                  Shuck your corn. Get a large and wide bowl. Hold an ear of corn by the stem end with the opposite tip pressing down into the center of the bowl. Using a very sharp knife (serrated works well), saw the knife back and forth, working your way from the stem end down towards the bowl, cutting the corn kernels away from the cob as you go. Try to remove just the kernel layer (almost like a corn kernel rug). You dont want to cut out tough chunks of the cob, so make sure the knife moves straight down without digging too deep. Rotate the ear and cut down again. Keep rotating and cutting off the kernels until the cob is bare. Turn the knife around and milk the corn by rubbing the dull side of the knife up and down the cob all the way around. Repeat all steps with the other ears of corn. Set aside.                                  Place a large pot of water on high heat for the pasta. Add salt.                                  While waiting for the water to boil, spoon 5 tablespoons garlic oil (from the cooled pot of garlic confit) into a medium-sized pot. Squeeze all garlic cloves out of their skins into the oil in the pot. With the back of a wooden spoon, break the cloves apart  a bit into the olive oil. Warm for 30 seconds on medium heat. Add corn and salt. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Turn heat down to low. Add tomatoes. Stir for one minute. Taste. It will probably need a bit more salt. Adjust as needed. Pour into a large serving bowl. Set aside.                                  When the water is boiling, slide in your pasta. Cook until al dente. Add drained pasta to the tomato/corn/garlic mixture. Toss. Add a few more splashes of garlic oil. Taste. Add more salt or garlic oi as needed. Garnish with parsley leaves. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"With a paring knife, puncture a tiny hole in each clove of garlic.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404745,"name":"knife","image":"chefs-knife.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place cloves in a small pot and cover with the olive oil.

The peanuts will go through stages of: crushed, crushed into a fine powder, a paste, a thicker paste, a big “dough ball”, and then the ball will break down into runnier peanut butter. At the point the peanut butter is runny, continue processing for about 1 to 2 more minutes, making sure the peanut butter is as smooth as desired. Add the ginger cookies, cinnamon, vanilla, and process for 1 to 2 minutes, or until smooth and incorporated. I add the cookies whole through the feed tube but if using a weaker or older food processor, crumbling the cookies in your hand first and sprinkling them in may prevent your machine from struggling. Add the white chocolate and blend until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. I've made this with up to 2 cups white chocolate and at 1 cup, it's not discernible but at 2 cups it is more so. Transfer spread into a glass jar or other container with a lid.  Store spread either in the refrigerator or at room temperature. At room temperature it firms up some but stays soft. In the refrigerator, because of the white chocolate, it does harden but softens up again after ten minutes at room temperature. I estimate that it could be stored at room temperature for at least two weeks without issue, but with anything, let common sense be your guide. In the refrigerator it will keep for months. The shelf life at either room temp or in the refrigerator will far exceed your willpower and I fine longterm storage issues to be moot. Recipe can be kept vegan and gluten-free by using regular roasted peanuts rather than honey roasted, gingersnaps that are vegan and gluten-free, and vegan white chocolate. Another option for gluten-free is to make homemade gingersnap or molasses cookies using your favorite GF recipe, bake the cookies to an extra-crisp state, and add those to the recipe in place of storebought cookies.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Add peanuts to the canister of a food processor, process on high power until creamy and smooth, about 5 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides of the canister if necessary however I find the less scraping and interruptions, the better.

Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Position a rack in the center of your oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees (F).Pour the olive oil into a 9×13-inch baking dish. Add a bit more if the bottom of the pan isn’t completely covered. Add the thyme, sliced garlic and red chili flakes; bake until the oil is fragrant, about 10 minutes.While the oil cooks, bring a pot of water to boil and cook the orzo according to package directions. Drain and set aside.Add the shrimp to the oil mixture and toss with tongs until coated. Bake the shrimp until pink and firm, 8 to 10 minutes.Add the lemon juice and 1/2 tsp. salt, toss well. Let rest at room temperature until the oil cools slightly, about 5 minutes.Meanwhile, heat 2 tsp. oil in a medium non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add grated lemon rind and minced garlic; saute for 1 minute. Remove from heat.Add the orzo, parsley, cheese, remaining 1/4 tsp. salt and pepper to the skillet and toss well.Discard the thyme from the shrimp mixture. Serve shrimp on top of the orzo, making sure to spoon some of the infused olive oil onto the pasta. Sprinkle with more cheese, if desired. Great with Lemon-Butter Broccoli (recipe below) and French bread to dip into the remaining olive oil.Fill a large pot with 1 inch of water and bring to boil.Put chopped broccoli in a steamer basket and place inside the pot. Cover and cook until crisp tender, about 3-4 minutes. Remove pot for heat.Melt butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. When butter foams, add lemon juice and cook for 30 seconds.Add broccoli, grated lemon, salt and pepper. Cook, tossing occasionally for 1 minute or until the broccoli is heated through.

Preheat oven to 350F. Line 24 muffin cups with cupcake papers. Set aside.2. In a small bowl, combine the flours. Set aside.3. In a large bowl, cream the butter with an electric mixer until smooth. Add the sugar gradually and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.4. Add the dry ingredients in 3 parts, alternating with the milk and vanilla. With each addition, beat until the ingredients are incorporated but do not over beat. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the batter in the bowl to make sure the ingredients are well blended.5. Divide the batter between the cupcake liners, filling them about 3/4 full. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center of the cupcake comes out clean.6. Cool the cupcakes in the pans for 15 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.For the frosting:1. Place the butter in a large mixing bowl. Add 4 cups of the sugar and then the milk and vanilla. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 3 to 5 minutes.

Cover bowl tightly with plastic or transfer the dough to two gallon-sized zipper lock bags, seal, and refrigerate for at least 8 and up to 72 hours.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and dust the top with additional flour. Using a bench scraper, divide the dough into six even pieces, approximately six ounces each. Using floured hands, shape each piece into a neat ball by gathering the dough towards the bottom. Coat four small containers with non-stick cooking spray or olive oil (large cereal bowls work great for this) and add one dough ball to each bowl. Lightly spray top of dough ball with non-stick cooking spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap, and allow to rise at room temperature for 2 hours (dough should roughly double in volume).                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Meanwhile, drain tomatoes in fine meshed strainer and break them up with your fingers, squeezing excess juice out from the interior. Transfer the tomatoes to a blender with a 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Cut the mozzarella into 1/2-inch chunks and place on a plate on a triple layer of paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Place another triple layer of paper towels or clean dish towel on top of the cheese and stack another plate on top. Allow the excess water to blot out for at least 10 minutes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Transfer 1 ball of dough to a medium bowl filled with flour and flip to coat. Lift it and gently pat off the excess flour. Transfer it to a floured surface and gently stretch it into a 10-inch circle, leaving the outer 1-inch edge slightly thicker than the center. The best way to do this it to start by gently stretching with your fingertips. Pick up the slightly stretched dough and place it on the opened face of your left hand. Toss it back and forth between your opened hands, rotating it slightly with each toss until it stretches out to around 8-inches in diameter. Return it to the work surface. With your left hand flat in the center of the round, use your right hand to stretch the edge of the dough out, rotating as needed until it is an even 10-inches in diameter.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Have your tomato sauce, drained cheese, pizza dough, olive oil, kosher salt, and basil leaves ready and close to the stovetop. Preheat the broiler to high and arrange the rack such that you can just barely fit a 12-inch heavy-bottomed oven-proof cast iron or stainless steel skillet on top of it. Dust skillet with flour, tap out excess, then heat the skillet over high heat and heat until lightly smoking, about three minutes. Transfer one dough round to the skillet. It should fill up the entire bottom surface. Working quickly, spread two tablespoons sauce evenly over the dough, leaving the outer 1-inch border un-sauced. Top with 1/6 of the cheese chunks. Season with kosher salt. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and scatter four basil leaves over the surface. Transfer skillet to broiler and broil until pizza is puffed and darkly charred in spots (this can take anywhere between 1 1/2 to 4 minutes, depending on the strength of your broiler). Return the skillet to the stovetop and cook until the bottom is darkly charred in spots, using a thin metal spatula to peek after about 1 minute (depending on the skillet you use, you may skip this step if the pizza is already charred). Transfer the pizza to a cutting board and serve immediately. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to bake remaining pizzas.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine flour, salt, yeast, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"yeast-granules.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404665,"name":"stand mixer","image":"stand-mixer.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Whisk to combine.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add water and knead on low speed just until mixture comes together and no dry flour remains.

                              For the Cake: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 10-inch springform pan with 1 tablespoon butter and line exterior of pan with foil. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon Maldon salt over pan bottom.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Pulse the sugar with 1 tablespoon lavender and 1 teaspoon tea.

Add cocoa, vanilla, and tables salt and whisk until completely incorporated.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Add about 1/4 cup of warm chocolate to the egg yolk mixture and stir until completely incorporated.

Increase speed to medium-high and beat whites until soft peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly add remaining 1/2 cup sugar and continue beating until stiff, glossy peaks form.                                                                                                                             8                                                                            Whisk about 1/3 of the meringue into the chocolate batter until completely incorporated.

Cook muffins 7 to 15 minutes each side until deep golden brown. If muffins puff up too much during cooking (and they probably will), cover them with a sheet of parchment paper and place a baking sheet on top to act as a weight. The muffins are cooked through when an instant read thermometer inserted in the center reads about 200 degrees F.If the muffins are sufficiently browned on both sides but are still not fully cooked in the center, place them on a clean baking sheet and transfer to the preheated oven for about 10 minutes.Repeat the whole cooking/baking process (steps 7 and 8) with remaining dough.Cool muffins completely. Use a fork to gently pry muffins open, so you get all the nooks and crannies.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl or bowl of a stand mixer, add flour, sugar, yeast, salt and egg (do not stir).","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"yeast-granules.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"egg.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404665,"name":"stand mixer","image":"stand-mixer.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Combine milk and butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat; stir and heat until an instant read thermometer reads between 110 and 115 degrees F.","ingredients":[{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"milk.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404789,"name":"kitchen thermometer","image":"food-thermometer.jpg"},{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Remove from heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Pour milk mixture into bowl; stir just until a dough forms.

Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                Cook pasta according to package directions.
