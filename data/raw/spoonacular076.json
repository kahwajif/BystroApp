d'oeuvre"],"diets":["gluten free"],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"For the Cake LayersI recommend making the cake twice instead of doubling the recipe. While you're measuring out the ingredients for the cake, just measure out enough for the second batch at the same time so it's easier the second time around.The first time through, leave one layer white. Add a few drops food coloring to the second layer prior to baking (I used 5 drops in my lightest layer).When making the third and fourth layers, add a bit more food coloring to each layer such that you'll have gradually darker layers (I used 9 and 18 drops for my darker layers).Allow all layers to cool completely.For the Passion Fruit CurdIn a saucepan, whisk the sugar and cornstarch.Whisk in the passion fruit nectar, egg yolks and vanilla seeds and cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until thick, 6 minutes.Remove from the heat; whisk in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until incorporated.Scrape the filling into a glass bowl, press a sheet of plastic wrap on the surface and refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours.For the FrostingPut the chopped white chocolate into a small bowl. Heat the chocolate in 30 second increments in the microwave set to 60% power. Stir after each increment, and continue to heat 30 seconds at a time, until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Set aside and allow to completely cool.Once white chocolate has cooled, sift the salt and powdered sugar over the butter, in a large bowl. Cream the butter and sugar mixture together until light and fluffy, scraping the sides of the bowl as needed.Measure the whipping cream into a cup, and stir in the vanilla extract.With the mixer running on low speed, gradually pour the cream mixture the bowl.Once the cream mixture has been incorporated into the frosting, fold on the melted (but cooled) white chocolate until incorporated.Increase the mixer speed to medium-high, and beat frosting for an additional 3 minutes.To Assemble the CakeOnce all of the cake layers have cooled, level each of the layers except the white layer.Place a small amount of frosting on a cake board to stabilize the cake. Center the darkest layer on the cake board. Pipe a small ring around the edge of the cake layer. This will ensure the filling doesn't spill out between the layers.Spoon a heaping 1/3 cup filling into center of cake and spread to the edges.Stack the next lighter cake on top and continue the process until all layers are stacked and the white layer is on top.Frost the cake with a crumb coat and chill in the fridge for at least an hour.To Decorate the CakePlace ~3/4 cup of frosting into two separate bowls (you'll have three bowls of frosting at this point, two with 3/4 cup, and one with the rest, which will be more than 3/4 cup).The bowl with the most frosting will be your lightest color. Add food coloring to that bowl first until the desired color is reached. Color the other two bowls of frosting such that you have three shades of frosting.Alternatively, leave all of the frosting one color.Place the cake on a rotating cake stand. Starting at the bottom, pipe a row of roses along the cake using the darkest frosting color. You're going to pipe three rows of roses, so make sure they cover about 1/3 the height of the cake.Continue with a second row of roses in the next lighter shade of frosting.

medium-high heat. Wipe down the grates with an oil-blotted towel to clean and create a nonstick surface.                          Squeeze the lemon halves (catching the seeds and discarding) into a large bowl, then add the lemon halves to the bowl as well. Add the wine, olive oil, capers, salt, chile flakes, peppers and garlic. Whisk to combine and set aside.                          Clean and cut the crabs: remove the hard shell, cut off the tail and discard the gills, then cut the halves into pieces so each piece has 2 to 3 legs. Place the crabs, scallops, shrimp and halibut in the marinade and gently toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour, giving it a stir after 30 minutes.                          For the puree: Place the tomatoes, bell peppers, fennel and onions in a large gratin dish, and then drizzle with three tablespoons of the olive oil, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add the fennel seeds and chile flakes and toss to coat everything evenly. Cut the top off of the bulb of garlic to expose the cloves. Place the garlic on a large piece of foil and drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with a pinch each salt and pepper. Wrap up the foil into a tight pouch. Place the vegetables on the grill and the garlic pouch in the corner of the grill over indirect heat. Grill the vegetables on both sides until tender and charred around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the vegetables and set aside. Roast the garlic over direct heat until medium brown and paste-like, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the grill, cool enough to handle, then squeeze out the garlic paste from the bulb and set aside. Working in batches, add the vegetables and garlic paste to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until sauce-like in appearance and consistency. Transfer to a large saute pan set over medium heat. Stir and simmer until the sauce slightly thickens, 7 to 8 minutes. Add half of the basil and the ouzo, then remove from the heat and set aside.                          Grill the crab for 4 to 5 minutes, then flip and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. Grill the shrimp for 3 to 4 minutes then flip and cook for 2 to 3 minutes more. Finally add the halibut and scallops to the grill; cook for 2 to 3 minutes on the first side then turn over and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes. Remove all the seafood from the grill to a platter.                          Serve the seafood family-style with the sauce generously ladled on top. Garnish with the remaining basil, the quartered lemons and the reserved fennel fronds.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the cioppino: Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.

Set aside.In a large bowl of an electric mixer, add the egg yolks and beat 3 to 5 minutes on medium-high speed until the egg yolk foam becomes thick and lemon colored. With the mixer on medium speed, slowly add  cup of the sugar to the eggs, either one tablespoon at a time, or in a very slow steady stream, taking from 2 to 3 minutes to add all of the sugar, and beating until the eggs and sugar are fully incorporated. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly. The mixture will be thick and a pale yellow color. Add the vanilla and continue mixing for another minute. Reduce mixer speed to low and add the food coloring and mix until well blended.With the mixer on low speed, gradually add about  of the flour mixture, mix just until blended, and then add the remaining half, mix just until blended, scraping down the side of the bowl as needed.In another large mixing bowl and using clean beaters, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining  cup sugar; continue beating until stiff peaks form. Using a balloon type whisk or large rubber spatula, gently fold about  of the beaten egg whites into the batter to lighten the batter, and then fold the remaining egg whites in.Bake: Spoon the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the surface with the back of a large spoon or large offset spatula. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until the top of the cake springs back when lightly touched. Remove from oven, immediately loosen edges of cake from pan and turn the cake over onto the prepared towel. Carefully peel off the parchment paper, and then roll the cake and towel together tightly, starting with the narrow end. Place seam side down on a wire cooling rack to cool completely.In a large mixing bowl and using clean beaters, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Set aside.In a small heavy saucepan, combine sugar, water, and corn syrup to create syrup. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until sugar has dissolved and syrup is clear. Increase heat to high and bring syrup to a boil. Boil without stirring until syrup reaches 248 degrees, using a candy or instant read thermometer to gauge the temperature, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.With the mixer at medium-high speed, pour the hot syrup slowly, in a thin steady stream into the beaten egg whites. Continue beating until the mixture is cool, thick, and shiny, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the peppermint extract and beat for another minute. Frosting must be used immediately.Carefully unroll cooled cake but dont try to make the cake lie completely flat, the edge should remain curled so that the cake doesnt split.Spread about 2 cups of the frosting over the cake, spreading the frosting evenly under the curled edge and leaving a 1 inch border on the far side. Gently re-roll the cake without the towel, starting with the curled end. Place seam side down on a serving plate. Spread the remaining frosting over the top of the cake.Sprinkle the crushed peppermint candies over the top of the cake.Cake can be served immediately, or cover and refrigerate several hours before serving. Refrigerate leftovers.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium mixing bowl, combine flour and cocoa; sift or whisk together to mix.

Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight.                          Make the filling: Put the cherries in a medium bowl. Whisk 1/4 cup cherry juice with the cornstarch in a small bowl. Transfer to a small saucepan and add the remaining 1 1/4 cups cherry juice and the sugar. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook, whisking constantly, until thick and glossy, about 30 seconds. Pour over the cherries. Add the almond extract and gently fold to combine.                          Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven with a baking sheet on the lower rack; preheat to 425 degrees F. Roll out the dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease the dough into a 9-inch pie plate. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp with your fingers or a fork.

stir with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until butter is melted and mixture is thickened, about 7 to 10 minutes. Do not allow mixture to boil or the egg yolks will curdle. Remove pan from heat.In a medium mixing bowl, combine cake flour, all purpose flour, baking powder, and salt; sift or whisk together to mix. Set aside.In a small mixing bowl, stir the milk and lemon juice together. Set aside. Tip: Dont worry if the milk appears to curdle.In a large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter, lemon zest, and sugar until light and fluffy. Tip: To cream, start by placing the butter and lemon zest in the bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed begin by beating the butter and lemon zest about 1 minute until it is smooth and light in color. With the mixer still on medium speed, slowly add the sugar to the butter, either one tablespoon at a time, or in a very slow steady stream, taking from 4 to 8 minutes to add all of the sugar, and beating until the butter and sugar are fully incorporated and the mixture is a light, or pale yellow color, with a fluffy texture. While adding the sugar, stop the mixer occasionally to scrape the mixture off the paddle and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula so the mixture blends evenly.With the mixer on low speed, add about one third of the flour mixture, mix just until the flour is almost completely blended. Scrape the bowl down, and add about one half of the milk mixture, blending just until mixed. Scrape the bowl down again and continue alternating with the flour mixture and milk mixture, ending with the last portion of the flour, and stirring just until blended. Set aside.In another large mixing bowl and using clean beaters, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until foamy, add the cream of tartar, and continue beating until stiff peaks form. Using a balloon type whisk or large rubber spatula, gently fold about  of the beaten egg whites into the batter to lighten the batter, and then fold the remaining egg whites in.Bake: Spoon the batter into the prepared pans and smooth the surface with the back of a large spoon. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until a long toothpick, wooden skewer, or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and place pans on a wire cooling rack to cool for 10 to 15 minutes then remove cake from the pans and place the cake on the wire cooling rack to finish cooling.In a large bowl, combine mascarpone cheese, vanilla, confectioners sugar, and whipping cream; use an electric mixer and beat together until mixture is smooth and stiff peaks form, about 2 to 4 minutes. Do not overbeat.Mascarpone frosting should be used immediately, or refrigerate until needed.Use a long serrated kitchen knife to split each cake layer into 2 horizontal layers.Place one of the split cake layers on a serving plate; spread  of the chilled lemon curd (about  cup) over the layer leaving about  inch border all around. Repeat with the second and third layers. Place the last cake layer on top.Use an offset spatula to spread Mascarpone Cheese Frosting over top and sides of cake. If desired, reserve about 1 cups frosting to decorate top using a pastry bag and pastry tip and use a pastry comb around the side of the cakePlace fresh lemon slices, cut in half, on top of cake.Cover and refrigerate before serving. Refrigerate leftovers.Immediately pour the hot mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to strain out the lemon zest pieces and any bits of egg that may have curdled. Pour into an airtight container and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. The curd will continue to thicken as it cools.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium heavy saucepan over medium-low heat, combine butter, sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, and egg yolks.Cook and stir with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until butter is melted and mixture is thickened, about 7 to 10 minutes.

Transfer to a medium bowl and mix in 2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses, oil, garlic, 1/8 teaspoon salt and pepper.Using a sharp knife, make a vertical cut two-thirds of the way to the bottom of the pork. From there, slice outward horizontally to about 3/4 inch from the sides. Unfold the pork.Place the pork between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Using a meat mallet or heavy skillet, pound the pork to an even 1/2-inch thickness. Remove the plastic wrap. Using a spatula, spread the filling over the surface, leaving a 1-inch border. Starting at the short edge, roll the roast up fairly tightly, completely enclosing the filling. Tie the roast at 1 1/2-inch intervals with kitchen string.Season the roast with the remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt and pepper and coat with the remaining 2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses. Set the roast seam-side down on the prepared rack. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center registers 155F (it will increase to 160F as it rests), about 1 hour 10 minutes. Transfer the pork to a clean cutting board; tent with foil and let rest for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, prepare sauce: Combine pomegranate juice, broth, honey and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil until the sauce has reduced to 1 cup, 15 to 25 minutes. Mix cornstarch and water in a small bowl; add to the sauce and cook, whisking, until slightly thickened, about 1 minute.Remove the string and carve the roast into 3/4-inch-thick slices.

Knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes, then transfer to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a towel. Let the dough rise for an hour in a warm place.                          Meanwhile, for the filling: Coat the bottom of a medium pot with the vegetable oil and set over medium-high heat. Add the onions and saute until translucent and aromatic, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and saute 1 minute more. Add the curry powder, cumin, allspice, turmeric and bay leaf and cook for another 30 seconds to toast the spices. Add the chickpeas and stock and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the liquid has thickened and the chickpeas are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Season with salt.                          For the slaw: Combine the cilantro, carrot, green mango, cucumber and black pepper in a large bowl. Toss with the lime juice and season with salt. Set aside until ready to serve.                          Once the dough has risen, pinch it into six pieces and roll the pieces into golfball-size balls (roughly 1 3/4-inch). Transfer to a greased baking sheet and cover with a damp towel. Leave to rest for 15 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each ball into a 1/8-inch-thick oblong disc.                          Fill a deep frying pan with 1 to 2 inches of vegetable oil and heat the oil to 350 degrees F over medium-high heat.                          In batches, shallow-fry the discs of dough until golden but still pliant, 30 to 45 seconds per side. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet and season.                          Top each disc with a spoonful of curried chickpeas and a spoonful of slaw, then fold it over the filling. Serve with chutney and hot sauce on the side, and have lots of napkins ready.                          Cook's note: If you've got one, use a mandolin to slice the vegetables for the slaw.                          If your yeast doesn't foam after 5 minutes, it means it has died. Start over with fresh yeast.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"For the dough","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine 1/3 cup warm water (110 degrees F) with the honey and yeast in a small bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":19296,"name":"honey","image":"honey.png"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"yeast-granules.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.

In a bowl, combine the sugar, almonds, hazelnuts, corn starch, and salt. Stir with a whisk to remove any lump. Add to the creamed butter and mix until smooth. Add the almond extract and orange flower water, then the eggs, one at a time, mixing well between each addition. Cover and refrigerate for an hour or overnight.Divide the puff pastry in 2 equal pieces, and roll each one out to form a rough circle a little larger than 30 cm (12 inches) in diameter. Use a sharp knife and an upturned plate of the right dimension to cut a neat 30-cm (12-inch) circle out of one, and a slightly larger one with the other, adding, say, 6 mm (1/4 inch) all around the edge of the plate.Place the smaller of the two circles on a piece of parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. In a small bowl, combine the egg yolk with a tablespoon water (or milk, if you have it handy) until smooth. Using a pastry brush, brush the outer rim of the dough lightly with the eggwash by a width of about 2.5 cm (1 inch). Make sure not to wet the actual edge of the dough, or it will impede its rise.Pour the crème d'amande in the center and spread it out inside the eggwash ring with a spatula.Place a porcelain fève, a dried bean, or the trinket of your choice in the crème d'amande -- not in the center but closer to an edge, or your knife will keep running into it when you divide the galette. And if it is an elongated shape, make sure to orient it straight toward the center of the galette, again, to minimize the possibility of you hitting it with your knife (as you see in the picture below, mine was not, and sure enough, I cut right into the top of the little tower). Press it down gently to bury it.Transfer the second round of dough precisely on top of the first, smooth it out gently over the crème d'amande to remove any air pocket, and press it down all around the sides to seal.Using the back of the tip of your knife (i.e. the dull side), draw a decorative pattern on top of the galette: a diamond-shaped grid, optionally with double or triple lines, a flower pattern... see examples here, here, here and here.I chose to make a sun pattern as demonstrated in \">this video: you start from the center and draw an arc to reach the edge of the galette in a single, smooth gesture, exercising just enough pressure to score the dough without piercing it. You then turn the galette ever so slightly, draw a similar arc nested in the first one, and repeat until the entire galette is scored.\">this videoHolding your knife upright, blade down, and using the dull side of the blade, push the dough inward where each sun ray ends, to create a festooned pattern.Brush the top of the galette lightly with the eggwash: again, make sure it doesn't drip over the edges, or the eggwash will seal the layers of the puff pastry in this spot and it won't develop as well. Let it rest a minute then brush it lightly again with the eggwash. (As you can see on the picture below, my eggwash pooled a bit around the bulge of the crème d'amande, which resulted in a darker coloring around the sides; I didn't mind, but I'll be more careful next time.)Using the tip of your knife, pierce 5 holes in the top dough -- one in the center, and four around the sides, piercing through the pattern you've drawn -- to ensure an even rise.Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet or a tart pan with a removable bottom, and refrigerate for 1 hour. (Alternatively, you can place the galette in the freezer at this point, on the baking sheet or pan, and bake it the next day. Although I haven't tried it, I'm sure you could prepare it up to a week or so in advance: once the galette is thoroughly frozen, transfer it to a tightly sealed bag to avoid freezer burn.)Preheat the oven to 180°C (360°F); if the galette was in the freezer, take it out while the oven preheats. Insert the galette in the middle of the oven and bake for 30 minutes (35 if it was frozen), until puffy and golden brown.In the final minutes of baking, combine the tablespoon of confectioner's sugar with a tablespoon very hot water (heated until boiling in the kettle or the microwave). When the galette is done, remove it from the oven, brush it across the top with the syrup, and return it to the oven for a minute; this will give it a shiny finish.Place on a rack to cool completely (it will settle as it cools) and serve at room temperature. (Some people prefer it slightly warm, so they reheat it slightly in a warm oven before serving.) The traditional pairing is with Champagne or hard cider.Have one of the guests (usually the youngest) hide under the table if he's willing, or at least cover his eyes or turn his back to the table. Cut the galette into servings and, for each serving, have the guest decide who should have it. If your guests are unfamiliar with the tradition, make sure you warn everyone that a fève may be hiding in their slice. Whoever finds it is king/queen for the day, receives a paper crown, and gets to pick his/her queen/king (or king/queen for that matter) by giving her/him the second paper crown.Beat the butter until creamy, but avoid incorporating air into it.

For the waffles: Preheat an 8-inch round waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.                          In a large bowl, combine the whole wheat pastry flour, semolina flour, baking powder, sugar, Italian seasoning, salt, sun-dried tomatoes and Parmesan. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs until light and fluffy. Add the milk and olive oil; whisk to combine. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the wet ingredients. Stir until just combined; overmixing will make the waffles tough. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.                          Spray the waffle iron with cooking spray and fill with a heaping 8-ounce ladleful of the batter. Cook until golden brown and crispy, 4 to 5 minutes. Repeat with the remaining batter.                          For the pizza build: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.                          Place the waffles on a cooling rack set into a baking sheet. Spread 1/4 cup of the pizza sauce onto each waffle. Top with onions, olives, peppers, broccoli, or any combination thereof. Sprinkle with the mozzarella and cheddar. Transfer to the oven and cook until the cheese is melted, about 8 minutes. Top each waffle-pizza with kale chips and sweet potato chips just before serving.                          Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until soft and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, oregano, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes and honey, and stir to blend. Lower the heat and simmer until the sauce thickens and reduces by a third, about 45 minutes.                          Remove the sauce from the heat and blend until smooth using an immersion blender. Stir in the basil and butter. Season with salt and pepper.                          Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Spread chicken strips onto microwaveable plate; cover with waxed paper.

Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Add the cubed butter and toss to coat. Dump the mixture out onto a clean surface and use a rolling pin to roll the butter into thin sheets, combining it with the flour. Use a bench scraper to scrape the rolling pin and to bring the mixture back into a pile as necessary. Continue until all of the butter is incorporated into the flour. Mixture will be very flaky. Return mixture to the bowl and place in the freezer for 15 minutes to chill the butter.2. Remove from freezer and add the buttermilk. Use a spoon and then your hands to stir the mixture until it comes together into a ball. If mixture is too dry, add the water a tablespoon at a time. Divide the dough in two and flatten into disks. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour and up to 3 days.3. While the dough is chilling, make the peach pie filling. In a large bowl, combine peaches, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cornstarch, and vanilla extract. Gently stir until mixed well. 4. When ready to roll out, let the dough rest at room temperature for five minutes. On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into a rough 13 inch circle. Dough should be about 1/4 inch thick. Transfer dough to pie dish. Fill pie with peach filling. Repeat with the second disk of dough. Cut dough and make a lattice over the filling. You can also leave the circle intact and cover the filling completely, cutting a few vents with a sharp knife, but I went with a lattice top for my peach pie. 5. Fold the edges of the top and bottom crusts together and use your index fingers and thumb to pinch into a pattern. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. 6. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven for 45 minutes or until the pie is bubbling and the crust is golden brown. Let the pie cool completely on a wire cooling rack before cutting. Note-you can use this same pie crust to make apple pie, berry pie, strawberry rhubarb pie, etc. Use your favorite filling!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the cubed butter and toss to coat.

servingsFor the Ham Stock:1 large meaty hambone3 quarts of water2 whole celery stalks (ribs) with leaves, rinsed and cut into large chunks2 large carrots, unpeeled, rinsed and cut into large chunks1 large onion, unpeeled and quartered4 sprigs of fresh parsley2 bay leaves1/2 teaspoon of whole peppercornsFor the Dumplings:3 tablespoons of vegetable shortening1-1/2 cups of self-rising flour1/2 cup buttermilk or milk1/4 cup of reserved ham stockSalt, only if needed, to tastePlace ham bone in a large stockpot, along with the remaining stock ingredients. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 2 hours or until mixture is reduced to about 1-1/2 quarts. Strain, reserving the bone and stock; discard vegetables. Once cooled, pick off any meat from the bone, reserving the meat and discarding the bone. Refrigerating the stock overnight is best when possible.When ready to prepare dumplings, set aside 1/4 cup of the stock. Mix together the dumpling ingredients until they form a soft dough. Bring ham stock to a rolling boil. Using a small spoon, scoop out and drop into boiling broth and cover immediately so that the dumplings begin to steam; simmer on low about 10 minutes before checking. Don't overcook or dumplings will be dense and hard. Taste broth and adjust seasonings if needed, adding freshly cracked black pepper. Carefully scoop broth and a few dumplings into individual serving bowls.Cook's Notes: May substitute 2 or 3 meaty ham hocks. If the bone or hocks you use are not very meaty, add in about 1 to 1-1/2 cups of chopped, smoked ham.Source: http://deepsouthdish.comPRINT THISRequires Adobe Reader - download it free!Deep South
