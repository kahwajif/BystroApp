plain round tip or a resealable plastic bag 12 paper cupcake liners              For the vanilla-bourbon cupcakes: Position a rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners.                          Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise with a paring knife, and scrape down the length with the back of the knife to remove the seeds. Add the seeds and granulated sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer, and beat on medium-high speed for 1 minute. Slowly add the butter, and beat until pale and fluffy, about 5 minutes. While continuing to beat, add the eggs 1 at a time, scraping down the bowl with a spatula as needed. Add the bourbon, and reduce the mixer speed to medium-low (the mixture will look curdled, but that's OK).

For the minty frosting: Mix the butter, sugar and salt in the bowl of the stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on low speed until the sugar has been incorporated, about 2 minutes. Add the liqueur and peppermint extract, and mix on medium-high until smooth. Add the half-and-half, and beat until incorporated. Refrigerate the frosting for about 15 minutes to firm up.

Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc are great choices for Salmon. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. You could try Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay.

Process the other half in a food processor until slightly chunky; add to the diced salmon.                          In a separate bowl, combine the cilantro, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, smoked paprika, garlic and lime juice. Add the cilantro mixture to the salmon and stir gently until just combined. Season with salt and pepper. Shape the salmon mixture into 4 patties and chill, covered, in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.                          Heat a grill to medium-high heat or heat a nonstick skillet with the grapeseed oil over medium-high heat. Cook the salmon patties until browned on the first side, 3 to 4 minutes; flip and cook until browned on the second side, about 3 minutes more. Place on the buns and top each with a dollop of Rhubarb Chutney. Garnish with some lettuce, red onion and pickles, as desired.                          Combine the rhubarb, cherries, brown sugar, blueberries, cherry juice, red pepper flakes, red onion, ginger and garlic in a large saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent, about 20 minutes. Stir in the honey and vinegar and continue to cook over medium-low heat until it coats the back of a spoon, about 15 minutes more.

Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 24 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":440954,"title":"Fonterutoli Chianti Classico","description":"Color: Deep purplish-red but bright and exceptionally concentrated.Bouquet: Extremely intense and complex with scents of cherries and raspberries accompanied by light toasty and spicy shadings.Flavor: The impact in the mouth is incisive but soft due to a substantial structure of tannins in which those that are soft and well rounded stand out. Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8073684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Ffonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998%2F12434"}]},"instructions":"In a large skillet or dutch oven with a lid, heat olive oil over medium-high heat.

For the crust: Spray a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray. Add the graham crackers and sugar to the bowl of a food processor and process until fine crumbs form (you should have about 1 1/2 cups). Add the margarine and 2 tablespoons water to a measuring cup and melt in the microwave; add to the crumbs and blend until the mixture looks like wet sand.

Toss with the chicken to coat. Set aside and marinate for 30 minutes or cover and marinate in the fridge as long as overnight.\nRinse and Cook The Rice: In a large bowl cover rice with cold water by a few inches, swish it with your hands to release the starch and pouring off the cloudy water. Repeat 2 or 3 times until the water is clear. Cook the rice partially  about  less time than the package recommends. I usually cook mine 8-10 minutes. Scoop rice into a bowl and cool.\nCook The Chicken: Roughly chop or break apart the plum tomatoes and put them in a small bowl with the tomato paste and stir well to combine. Set aside. Heat oil or ghee in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the cardamom pods and cumin seeds. Fry, stirring with a wooden spoon, for 15  20 seconds until fragrant. Add the onions and saut for 8 minutes or so, stirring occasionally, until they soften. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons of ginger-garlic paste and the ground coriander. Cook, stirring, for 30 seconds or so until fragrant. Add the chicken and spread it out in the pan into an even layer. Turn the heat to medium-high and cook chicken, undisturbed, for 3 minutes. Flip chicken over and cook it on the other side for 2 minutes. Pour in the tomatoes and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer and turn down the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cover the pan and cook for 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.\nAssemble The Biryani: Spread half the rice evenly over the chicken. Sprinkle on 1 tablespoon chopped mint, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro,  teaspoon garam masala and  teaspoon salt. Drizzle on 2 tablespoons of saffron milk. Repeat with the rest of the rice, herbs, remaining  teaspoon garam masala,  teaspoon salt and saffron milk. Cover the pan and simmer on very low heat for 10 minutes.

Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the coconut, almonds, chocolate chips,and beat on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds. Using alarge cookie scoop, 1/4-cup measure, or your hands, form approximately 13 equal-sized mounds of dough, roll into balls, and flatten slightly. Tip - Strategically chocolate chips on top of each mound by taking chipsfrom the underside and adding them on top. Place mounds on a large plate or tray, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, up to 5 days. Do not bake with unchilled dough because cookies will bake thinner, flatter, and be more prone to spreading. Preheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with aSilpator spray with cooking spray. Place dough mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (I bake 8 cookies per sheet)and bake for about 10 to 11 minutes (I baked for just under 11 minutes), or until edges have set and tops are just set, even if slightly undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center; don't overbake. Coconut is prone to burning and undersides of cookies can easily become too dark so watch them closely. Cookies will be pale and look un-done, but firm up as they cool. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for about 10 minutes before serving. I let them cool on the baking sheet and don't use a rack. Cookies will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months. Alternatively, unbaked cookie dough can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 4 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or large mixing bowl and electric mixer) combine the butter, sugars, egg, extracts, and beat on medium-high speed until creamed and well combined, about 4 minutes.

Stir in the chocolate chips.Press the cookie dough into the bottom and sides of the greased tart pan. You may not need all the dough. Place the tart pan on a cookie sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes or until lightly golden on top.Meanwhile, make the caramel. In a dry, large deep heavy skillet cook the sugar over moderately high heat, stirring constantly with a heat proof rubber spatula until the sugar is melted and turns a deep golden caramel, remove the skillet from the heat, and into the side of the skillet carefully pour in the heavy cream and butter.Return the pot to the heat and, cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring until the caramel has thickened, about 3-5 minutes. Remove from the heat, add rum and vanilla bean seeds + a pinch of salt.Once the cookie is done baking, slowly pour the caramel over the cookie, spreading it out as needed. Let the tart stand until the caramel is set, at least 45 minutes.To make the ganache, place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan, bring cream to a boil. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate, and let stand for 2 minutes, then stir with a rubber spatula until smooth. Pour the ganache over the set tart while the ganache is still warm. Let the tart set at room temperature for at least 2 hours or 1 hour in the fridge before serving.Just before serving, make the meringue. Using an electric mixer, beat egg whites in medium bowl until frothy. Beat in cream of tartar. With mixer running, gradually add sugar. Beat until stiff peaks form. Spoon meringue over the tart.

Butter an 8x8 baking dish.\n\nParboil the potatoes: Scrub the potatoes clean, but leave the skins on. Place them in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Allow to boil for about 10 minutes.\nTurn off heat and let the potatoes sit in the hot water for another 10 minutes. When ready, you should be able to pierce the potatoes with a fork, but still feel slight resistance. Drain the potatoes and set aside until cool enough to handle.\nIf making the potatoes ahead, cool to room temp, cover, and store in fridge for up to 3 days.\n\nMeanwhile, cook the onions and peppers: In a medium skillet, melt 5 tablespoons butter, cook the onions and bell pepper until the onions are soft and translucent, about 6 minutes.

Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8073684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Ffonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998%2F12434"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the broiler.
