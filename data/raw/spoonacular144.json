Special equipment: latex or other thin food-safe gloves; tweezers, optional; an immersion blender, optional              Make the truffles: Put the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with an inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl with the chocolate over, but not touching, the water. Stir the chocolate occasionally until melted and smooth. (Alternatively, put the chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Melt at 50 percent power in the microwave until soft, about 1 minute. Stir, and continue to heat until completely melted, about 1 minute more.)                          Meanwhile, bring the cream and honey to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat (or in the microwave). Gradually whisk the cream into the chocolate until smooth and shiny. Whisk in the butter until very smooth. If possible, switch to an immersion blender and blend for about 1 minute for a satiny texture. Cover the surface of the chocolate with plastic wrap; chill in the refrigerator until firm, about 1 hour.                          Transfer 2 tablespoons of the chocolate mixture to a small resealable plastic bag and snip a tiny piece off one corner. Twist the top of the bag to push the chocolate mixture down to the cut corner. Set the prepared bag aside.                           Line a 13-by-9-inch baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop slightly rounded tablespoon-size portions from the remaining chilled chocolate mixture. With gloved hands, roll each portion into a ball. Refrigerate until set, about 15 minutes.                          Decorate the truffles: Let the truffles soften slightly at room temperature for about 10 minutes to make it easier to insert the almond slices. Using a tweezers if desired, gently insert a row of 8 almond slices pointed-ends down in the back of each truffle to make a fanned turkey tail. Press a candy corn, pointy-end facing toward you, on the top of each truffle to make the turkey's face and beak. Press an almond slice underneath each candy corn beak to make the turkey's waddle. Place two almond slices underneath each truffle to make the turkey's feet.                          Warm the reserved bag of chocolate mixture in the microwave until soft, 5 to 8 seconds. Squeeze the bag to pipe eyes onto the candy corn faces, and pipe decorative striped lines across the almond tails. Let set at room temperature for 30 minutes.                          Once set, the truffles can be held in a cool spot, out of the refrigerator, for up to 2 hours. Otherwise, refrigerate, covered, for up to 5 days. The truffles taste best if served at room temperature, not straight from the refrigerator.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Special equipment: latex or other thin food-safe gloves; tweezers, optional; an immersion blender, optional","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404776,"name":"immersion blender","image":"immersion-blender.png"}]}]},{"name":"Make the truffles","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Put the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl.

lightly toast the chilies, turning them from time to time so they do not burn. While they are still pliable, slit them open and remove the stem, seeds and veins.Cover them with hot water and let them soak for about 15 to 20 minutes.In the same skillet, toast the clove of garlic until golden brown, taking care not to burn it. Halve it, removing any green that may be in the center. Set aside.Add 1 tablespoons of the lard to the skillet and fry the almonds until they are well browned, stirring frequently so they do not burn. Crush them slightly and set aside. Skin the plantain, slice it lengthwise and fry it until golden on both sides.Place the plantains, almonds and broiled tomatoes into a blender or food processor and blend to a smooth puree; add a little water if necessary. Scrape the puree into a small bowl and set aside.Without washing the mixer or food processor, blend the chilies with 1/2 cup of the water used to soak them, the spices and garlic to a smooth puree. Heat the other tablespoon of lard in the skillet and cook the chili puree on high heat about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the tomato/plantain mixture and then return to the heat, cooking for about 5 minutes on medium heat, stirring all the time so it does not stick (be careful, it can spatter about some).Stir the cup of the beef broth gradually into the sauce and continue cooking it for a minute or so, then strain through a coarse seive. Return the sauce to the skille over low heat and cook for another 15 minutes, stirring occasionally and salting to taste.While the mole is finishing, heat the tablespoon of lard in a medium skillet over medium heat and cook the onion until soft and nearly translucent, about 5 or 6 minutes. Add the garlic and cook another minute more.Stir in the grated cauliflower and water; cover and cook until the cauliflower is still firm, but no longer raw, 4 or 5 minutes. Stir in the lime juice and cilantro. Season to taste with salt and pepper; cover and keep warm.Crack the eggs into the mole and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the egg whites are set but the yolks are still soft.

                             To make the crust, put the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse a few times to mix. Scatter the butter over the top and pulse until the butter is in pea-size pieces. Break the cream cheese into 3 or 4 pieces and add to the food processor. Pulse until the butter and cream cheese are in pieces that vary in size from oat flakes to peas. With the motor running, slowly drizzle in the ice water, a little at a time, adding just enough for the dough to hold together when you pinch a clump between your fingers.

Coarsely grate the quince on the large holes of a box grater. Put all the fruits into a bowl, sprinkle with the brown sugar, flour, lemon juice, vanilla, and salt, and toss to coat evenly. Mix the butter evenly into the fruit.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Preheat the oven to 375°F, with a rack in the lower third. Turn a 17-by-12-inch rimmed baking sheet upside down, and cover the bottom with a sheet of parchment paper.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Place the dough disk between 2 sheets of lightly floured plastic film and roll out into a 14-inch circle. Peel off the top sheet of plastic film. If the circle is uneven, trim the edge of the dough with a pizza wheel or kitchen shears. Then, using the bottom sheet, flip the dough circle onto the parchment. (It will drape over the edges of the pan.) Carefully peel off the second sheet of plastic film.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Arrange the filling evenly over the dough, leaving a 2-inch border around the edges. Using the parchment as an aid, fold the border up and over the fruit, tucking and pleating the pastry to snugly fit over the fruit as you go.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            To finish, brush the pastry rim with half-and-half and sprinkle the turbinado sugar evenly over the pastry and the filling.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Bake until the fruit is tender when pierced with a knife and the dough is golden, about 50 minutes. Let the galette cool on the pan for 15 minutes, then slide the parchment with the galette onto a wire rack to finish cooling.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Melt the apricot preserves in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.

Divide shortbread dough in half and turn out onto two pieces of waxed paper. Form into two 8x2 1/2-inch logs, rolling carefully with your hands until well shaped/rounded.

With a sharp knife, carefully cut 1/4-inch slices from shortbread log and arrange on parchment-lined sheets. The dough will be thick and chunky, so you can use your fingers to help seal the edges of the cookies if they lose their shape or crumble when slicing. Refrigerate until the oven is well-heated.

For the mango honey glaze: Heat the oil in a large high-sided saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and onions cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the mangoes and cook until soft and juicy, stirring occasionally. Add the wine, orange and pineapple juices, 3 tablespoons honey and the chile de arbol and cook, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes.                          Transfer to a blender and carefully blend until smooth, about 2 minutes. Strain into a bowl, season with salt and pepper and more honey if needed. The mixture should be a thick puree. If too thick, thin with a touch of water. Let cool to room temperature before serving.                          For the chicken: Whisk together the buttermilk, chile powders, coriander, granulated garlic, onion powder, paprika and cinnamon in a large baking dish. Add the chicken and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours, turning a few times.                          Remove the chicken from the marinade and pat dry. Place the chicken on a baking rack set over a baking sheet, return to the refrigerator and let sit, uncovered, for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours.                          Remove the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before grilling. Heat the grill for indirect grilling.                          Brush the chicken on both sides with the oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place on the grill directly over the heat and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Flip the chicken over and continue grilling until the bottom is golden brown. Move to the cooler side of the grill, close the cover and continue grilling until cooked through, about 15 minutes longer. During the last few minutes, brush with some of the mango honey glaze. Remove to a platter and drizzle with more of the glaze.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]}]},{"name":"For the mango honey glaze","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat the oil in a large high-sided saute pan over medium-high heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the garlic and onions cook until soft, about 4 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":4,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add the mangoes and cook until soft and juicy, stirring occasionally.","ingredients":[{"id":9176,"name":"mango","image":"mango.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Add the wine, orange and pineapple juices, 3 tablespoons honey and the chile de arbol and cook, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11962,"name":"arbol chile","image":"dried-arbol-chiles.jpg"},{"id":19296,"name":"honey","image":"honey.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":5,"step":"Transfer to a blender and carefully blend until smooth, about 2 minutes.

this in a stand mister or in a large bowl if you're making the bread by hand). Let the yeast stand for a few minutes to proof it until you see that it is foamy (aka alive and working). Mix in the remaining honey, molasses, olive oil and eggs. With the dough hook attachment or with a wooden spoon (if you're mixing by hand) slowly add in the salt and flour and mix until the dough forms a ball.  Knead for 5 to 8 minutes (by hand or with the stand mixer dough hook). Transfer the dough to an olive-oil coated bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise for 1 hour or until almost doubled in size.Melt butter then add in the sugars, spices, salt,and molasses. Set asideDivide the dough into three even balls. Set two aside and roll out the first into a large round circle (___ diameter).  This doesn't have to be perfect. Spread out 1/3 of the ginger/cinnamon filling onto the circle and then roll the circle into a long, tight rope, trapping the filling within. Gently stretch the rope by squeezing it and holding it vertically, letting its own weight stretch it. Repeat with remaining two dough balls. On a parchment covered baking sheet, lay out all three long ropes side by side. Pinch together all three ropes at one end. Then braid the ropes just as you would normally braid anything. Once you're at the end of the ropes, fold the end under and pinch to seal. If you'd like to make a wreath or round braided bread, then you can pinch the two ends together (pictured above).Brush with egg wash (and set the egg wash aside for another brushing later) then let rise for another hour.Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Brush the challah braid again with the egg wash and then sprinkle with coarse sugar. Bake for 30-35 minutes (center of the loaf should be 195 degrees).

Combine the yogurt, a couple pinches of salt, a small pinch of pepper, and almost all of whichever herb you choose in a large bowl.2. Toast the bread until it is deeply golden. Rub each piece with a little butter, then take the clove of garlic, if using, and rub it against each slice.3. Gently crack and peel the eggs. Add them to the yogurt mixture and mash with a fork, being careful not to overdo it. You want the egg mixture to have some texture.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Spray the bottom and sides of a 9x13-inch pan with nonstick spray.  Then line the bottom with a piece of parchment paper- allowing excess parchment paper to come up two sides, and spray again (lightly).2.  Prepare the dough:  In a large bowl, use a hand mixer to combine the butter, sugar and salt.  Beat at medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes, until the mixture is soft, light and combined well.  Mix in the vanilla.  Gradually mix in 2 1/4 cups of the flour, and beat until well-incorporated.  Scrape the sides, as needed.  Transfer 3/4 of the dough to the prepared pan.  Use clean hands to press the dough evenly into the bottom of the pan.  Place the pan in the refrigerator while you make the topping.  Work the remaining 1/4 cup flour into the remaining dough with your fingers so that it forms small crumbs.  Set aside.3.  Prepare the filling:  In a medium saucepan, combine the filling ingredients.

with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Riesling.

Styled to be fuller in body and structure than most of Jadots Mâconnais wines, it is partially fermented and aged in oak casks to add breadth to the ripe fruit notes. The lovely, elegant Chardonnay nose, offset by a gentle touch of vanilla, carries into excellent balance of medium-full fruit and acidity on the palate and a lingering finish.","price":"$21.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/435857-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":7,"score":0.7545454545454546,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Flouis-jadot-chardonnay-2013%2F134128"}]},"instructions":"<ol><li>In a bowl thoroughly mix dry rub ingredients (cumin, mustard powder, cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder, 1 tablespoon salt, 2 teaspoons black pepper).</li><li>Dust and massage dry rub into pork chops, rest in fridge for about 10min</li><li>Prep mango, bell pepper, onion, scallions, tomato, and cilantro set aside.</li><li>Heat pan w/ oil to med high, sear pork chops. 2-3 minutes on each side.</li><li>Let pork chops rest 5-8 minutes before serving.</li><li>Take salsa bowl, add juice of a whole lime, add salt and pepper to taste.</li><li>Mix thoroughly</li><li>Place pork chop on plate and top with mango salsa.</li></ol>","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a bowl thoroughly mix dry rub ingredients (cumin, mustard powder, cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder, 1 tablespoon salt, 2 teaspoons black pepper).Dust and massage dry rub into pork chops, rest in fridge for about 10min","ingredients":[{"id":1002024,"name":"mustard powder","image":"dry-mustard.jpg"},{"id":1022020,"name":"garlic powder","image":"garlic-powder.png"},{"id":2026,"name":"onion powder","image":"onion-powder.jpg"},{"id":10010062,"name":"pork chops","image":"pork-chops.jpg"},{"id":2031,"name":"ground cayenne pepper","image":"chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":1002014,"name":"cumin","image":"ground-cumin.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Prep mango, bell pepper, onion, scallions, tomato, and cilantro set aside.","ingredients":[{"id":10211821,"name":"bell pepper","image":"bell-pepper-orange.png"},{"id":11291,"name":"green onions","image":"spring-onions.jpg"},{"id":11165,"name":"cilantro","image":"cilantro.png"},{"id":11529,"name":"tomato","image":"tomato.png"},{"id":9176,"name":"mango","image":"mango.jpg"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Heat pan w/ oil to med high, sear pork chops. 2-3 minutes on each side.","ingredients":[{"id":10010062,"name":"pork chops","image":"pork-chops.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Let pork chops rest 5-8 minutes before serving.Take salsa bowl, add juice of a whole lime, add salt and pepper to taste.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":10010062,"name":"pork chops","image":"pork-chops.jpg"},{"id":9159,"name":"lime","image":"lime.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}],"length":{"number":8,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":5,"step":"Mix thoroughly","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":6,"step":"Place pork chop on plate and top with mango salsa.","ingredients":[{"id":10010062,"name":"pork chops","image":"pork-chops.jpg"},{"id":9176,"name":"mango","image":"mango.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]}]}]}
