about 95 degrees F). Pour the warm milk into the bowl of a stand electric mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment and manually stir in the sugar and yeast. Cover with a towel and let stand until the yeast is foamy, about 5-10 minutes. Add the softened butter, eggs, and salt. Scrape down the sides and manually stir as needed. The butter will not fully incorporate and be \"piece-y.\" Gradually add the flour and beat at medium speed until a soft dough forms. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until the dough is soft and supple, about 10 minutes longer. *If you do not have a stand-mixer with a hook attachment, use a hand-held mixer to mix the butter, eggs, and salt together with the yeast mixture. Slowly add the flour and knead the dough by hand. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it with your hands for about 2 minutes. Form the dough into a ball and transfer it to a lightly greased bowl. Cover the dough and let sit in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours.Line the bottom of a 9×13 inch baking dish with parchment paper, gently sprayed with non-stick spray, leaving room on the sides. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. The cherries will release their juices in the next step, so to be extra careful and avoid staining, I suggest turning the dough out onto a floured nonstick surface rather than your counter. Using a rolling in, roll into a 10×24 inch rectangle. I used a ruler for accuracy. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick, even at the corners.Make The Filling: In a medium bowl, toss the frozen cherries with the sugar and cornstarch. Gently mash the cherries so there are no whole cherries left. Spread the cold sugared/mashed cherries evenly over the dough. Sprinkle with 2/3 cup mini chocolate chips. Tightly roll up the dough to form a 24-inch-long log. Cherry juices will seep out the sides. Cut into 15 even rolls (or 16) about 1.5 inches in width each. Arrange them in the prepared baking pan, cut sides up. Cover the rolls and let them rise in a warm place until they are puffy, about 2 hours. The cherries will release their juice at the bottom of the pan.Preheat the oven to 400F degrees. Cover the rolls with aluminum foil and bake for about 25 minutes, until they are golden and the chocolate chips are melted. Transfer the pan to a rack to cool for about 15 minutes.Make The Glaze: In a small bowl, whisk the confectioner’s sugar and heavy cream until smooth. Add more sugar or cream, depending how thick you want the glaze. Pour glaze over the rolls and sprinkle with more chocolate chips, if desired. Serve warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make The Dough: In a small saucepan, warm the milk over low heat until lukewarm (no need to use a thermometer, but to be precise: about 95 degrees F).","ingredients":[{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"milk.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404789,"name":"kitchen thermometer","image":"food-thermometer.jpg"},{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Pour the warm milk into the bowl of a stand electric mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment and manually stir in the sugar and yeast.

Set the temperature to 176°F and let the water come up to temperature. Make sure there is enough water in the pot to completely cover the jars.\n\nBeat together the cream cheese, sugar, and eggs: In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment or with a hand mixer, beat together cream cheese and sugar at medium speed until it’s light and fluffy. Then add in the eggs, one at a time, and beat until combined.\n\nAdd the buttermilk: Slowly add the buttermilk to the cream cheese mixture, mixing on low until it’s combined. Then add the vanilla and salt, and mix until the cheesecake mixture has no lumps and is an even consistency.\nStop the mixer a couple times and scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure everything is evenly incorporated.\n\nFill the jars: Transfer the mixture to a large measuring cup or bowl with a spout. Divide the cheesecake mixture among 6 jars, leaving about 1 1/2 inches of room at the top of each jar.

Line a 9-by-9-inch baking pan with aluminum foil, spray with cooking spray, and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, add 5 to 6 cups chips (about 5 big handful of chips from the bag) and with a wooden spoon or similar, poke and crush the chips to the size of a dime. You don’t want powder, but make them small. Add the chili, beans, salsa, 2 loosely-packed cups cheese (about two-thirds of the package), and stir to combine. Pour mixture into prepared pan and bake for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, remove pan from oven and spread sour cream in an even, flat layer over the casserole. Sprinkle 1 to 1 1/2 cups loosely packed cheese (the remaining cheese in the package) evenly over the top of the sour cream. Sprinkle 1 to 1 1/4 cups crushed corn chips over the top and bake for 9 to 12 minutes, or until top is browned to desired level. Serve immediately. Optionally, garish with a dollop of sour cream, a sprinkling of cheese, or a pinch of chopped cilantro or onion. Store leftovers in a Glad Freezerware container or similar airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Notes: Recipe is highly adaptable based on what kinds of canned goods you have on hand. Aim for about 30 ounces of wet ingredients, i.e. one 20-ounce can of beans and a 10-ounce jar of salsa. One 20-ounce jar of red pasta sauce and one 10 ounce-can of beans. Based on how chunky or wet your batter mixture is before baking, you may need to adjust baking times slightly. Bulk this up with canned corn, fresh or canned bell peppers, crushed tomatoes, or almost any vegetable you have on hand; add crumbled tofu, tempeh, pre-cooked meatballs, soy meatballs. Get creative. *To keep vegan, use vegan cheese and vegan sour cream (or thicker-style vegan yogurt). Take care all ingredients used are suitable for your dietary needs.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 375F.

Notes: Recipe is highly adaptable based on what kinds of canned goods you have on hand. Aim for about 30 ounces of wet ingredients, i.e. one 20-ounce can of beans and a 10-ounce jar of salsa. One 20-ounce jar of red pasta sauce and one 10 ounce-can of beans. Based on how chunky or wet your batter mixture is before baking, you may need to adjust baking times slightly. Bulk this up with canned corn, fresh or canned bell peppers, crushed tomatoes, or almost any vegetable you have on hand; add crumbled tofu, tempeh, pre-cooked meatballs, soy meatballs.

Try again!Then add flours, salt and 2 tablespoons olive oil and beat with a dough hook into a ball. If dough is dry, add a little water. Knead with mixer or by hand for about 5 minutes until you have a smooth, firm dough that isn't sticking to the sides or crumbling.Grease a large bowl with olive oil, place the dough ball in, cover and let rise in a warm area until double in size, about 1 hour.While dough is rising, prep remaining ingredients. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Toss eggplant in 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 teaspoon salt. Place slices on a foil lined cookie sheet and bake for about 20 minutes, or until eggplant is soft.

The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.\nThis wine has a broad range of food pairings, whether alone with some well chosen cheeses, richer fish preparations or a good old steak on the barbeque.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438099-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":8,"score":0.82,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fdutton-goldfield-dutton-ranch-pinot-noir-2014%2F154141"}]},"instructions":"Break or cut chocolate into pieces.
