bean seeds, vanilla extract and almond extract in a large bowl or bowl of a stand mixer until light and fluffy, about a full 3-5 minutes.Add the egg and eggnog and mix until evenly combined. Add half the flour, baking soda and salt, beating until combined. Then add the remaining flour and beat until the dough forms a ball.Generously flour your work surface. Divide the dough in half and flatten each half into a disk.Roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thickness. Make sure you are using enough flour or your dough will stick. You can also roll the dough out between two piece of wax paper. Cut out the cookies into your desired shapes. Carefully transfer the cookies to a parchment line baking sheet. Cover the baking sheet and place the baking sheet in the freezer, freeze until very firm, about 25 minutes. Roll out the leftover scraps, and repeat with the remaining disk of dough.Preheat oven to 350 degrees.Bake the cookies on the middle rack of the oven for 12-15 minutes or until just lightly golden brown. Do not over bake. Cool on the baking sheet five minutes and then transfer to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.To make the icing, combine the sugar and meringue powder in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mixing on low speed, add 6 tablespoons water. Mix until icing holds a ribbonlike trail on the surface of the mixture for 5 seconds when you raise the paddle. Add the vanilla bean seeds and nutmeg, mix until just combined.Frost the cooled cookies and decorate as desired. I like to keep things simple and use holiday sprinkles to decorate most of my cookies. You can also use food coloring and color the frosting red, green or whatever colors you like. To pipe the icing onto the cookies, add the icing to a gallon size ziploc bag (or a piping bag), then snip of a small portion of the corner off.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the cookies, cream the butter, sugar, vanilla bean seeds, vanilla extract and almond extract in a large bowl or bowl of a stand mixer until light and fluffy, about a full 3-5 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":2050,"name":"vanilla extract","image":"vanilla-extract.jpg"},{"id":1002050,"name":"almond extract","image":"extract.png"},{"id":93622,"name":"vanilla bean","image":"vanilla.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404665,"name":"stand mixer","image":"stand-mixer.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Add the egg and eggnog and mix until evenly combined.","ingredients":[{"id":1057,"name":"eggnog","image":"eggnog.png"},{"id":1123,"name":"egg","image":"egg.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add half the flour, baking soda and salt, beating until combined.

to gel up.In a microwave-safe bowl, add the almond milk and sucanat. Microwave at 20-second intervals, stirring between each one, until warm (not hot). Stir in the yeast and set aside for 5 minutes.In a stand mixer bowl with dough hook attachment, add the oil and extracts. Add the flax gel and yeast mixture.Turn the stand mixer on low and add the sorghum flour. Add the oat flour and salt. When all the flour is incorporated, turn the dough out onto a floured surface and lightly knead for ~5 minutes, or until dough can form into a ball and isn't super sticky.Spray a bowl with cooking spray and add the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm spot for 1 hour (it won't rise like regular dough, just get a little bit puffier than before).For the Filling:Roll the dough between two sheets of parchment paper, until 1/4\" thick.In a microwave-safe bowl, add the shortening and applesauce. Microwave at 30-second intervals, stirring between each one, until shortening is melted. Stir in the sucanat and cinnamon. Microwave the mixture for 20 seconds, stir, then spread onto the rolled out dough close to the edges.Roll the dough, then slice into 8.Spray a 6\" cake pan with cooking spray. Add the sliced cinnamon rolls to the pan and cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm spot for 1 hour (it won't rise very much).Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake for ~19 minutes, or until the edges of the rolls spring back when tapped. Let cool in the pan.For the Frosting:In a small bowl, stir together all the ingredients and scoop/pour over the cooled cinnamon rolls. Picture.Version #2: Cinnamon Rolls with a Special Chocolate FrostingFor the Dough:In a small bowl, whisk together the flax and water and set aside to gel up.In a microwave-safe bowl, add the almond milk and date sugar. Microwave at 20-second intervals, stirring between each one, until warm (not hot). Stir in the yeast and set aside for 8 minutes.Measure the oat flour, then add to a small bowl. Whisk in the rice flour, baking powder and salt.In a stand mixer bowl with dough hook attachment, add the oil and extracts. Add the flax gel and yeast mixture.Turn the stand mixer on low and slowly sprinkle in the dry ingredients. When all the flour is incorporated into the dough, the mixture should look a little bit sticky.Take the bowl off the mixer and gently fold in the oat flour one tablespoon at a time (I needed 3 tbs, just enough to make the mixture a little less sticky and scoopable).Spray a bowl with cooking spray and scoop in the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm area for one hour (it won't rise a lot, just a little bit).For the Filling:Put a Silpat on your counter and put a sheet of parchment paper on top. Sprinkle the paper with a tablespoon of oat flour and turn out the dough.Sprinkle another tablespoon of oat flour over the dough and top with another sheet of parchment paper. Roll the dough to 1/4\" thickness.In a small microwave-safe bowl, add the shortening and almond milk. Microwave at 20-second intervals, stirring between each one, until the shortening is melted. Stir in the date sugar and cinnamon (mixture should be spreadable and not too thick).Spread the mixture over the rolled out dough until very close to the edges. Roll the dough and slice into 8.Spray an 8\" cake pan with cooking spray (I used a 6\" cake pan and two silicone cupcake molds) and add the sliced rolls. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm area for one hour.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake for ~19 minutes, or until the rolls are slightly firm when tapped. Let cool slightly in the pan, then transfer onto a wire cooling rack.For the Frosting:In a small bowl, stir together all the ingredients and scoop over the cinnamon rolls.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Version #1: Cinnamon","ingredients":[{"id":2010,"name":"cinnamon","image":"cinnamon.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Rolls with Vanilla Bean Frosting","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"For the Dough:In a small bowl, whisk together the flax and water and set aside to gel up.In a microwave-safe bowl, add the almond milk and sucanat.

For the casserole: Heat a few inches of water to a low boil, add salt and the green beans and cook 3 to 4 minutes to tender-crisp, drain.                          Heat the EVOO in a large, deep skillet over medium to medium-high heat, add the mushrooms and lightly brown them, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the butter, shallots and garlic, season with salt, pepper and thyme, and stir 2 to 3 minutes more. Add the flour, stir a minute, add the wine, stir in the stock and thicken. Add the cream and Boursin and reduce the heat to simmer. Add the green beans and chicken and thicken a bit; stir in the tarragon.                          Transfer into a casserole dish and cool. Cover and refrigerate for a make-ahead meal.                          To reheat: Bring back to room temp. Bake at 375 degrees F until bubbly, 50 to 60 minutes; top with homemade or store-bought Fried Onions.                          Place the chicken in a large stockpot. Add the celery, carrot, onion, garlic, lemon, bay leaf, peppercorns and the herb bundle; season with salt. Cover the chicken with water and bring to a boil; reduce the heat to a low, rolling simmer. Simmer 60 to 75 minutes, then cool the chicken in its stock. Strain the stock. Remove the chicken in large pieces from the skin and bones. Cut half of the meat into bite-size chunks. Thinly slice or pull the remaining meat.                          Heat 2 to 3 inches of frying oil to 365 degrees F in a countertop fryer or in a deep medium pot over medium to medium-high heat. Separate the onion rings and soak in the buttermilk. Toss a few rings at a time into the flour and fry until crisp; drain on paper towels and repeat with the remaining onions.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]}]},{"name":"For the casserole","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat a few inches of water to a low boil, add salt and the green beans and cook 3 to 4 minutes to tender-crisp, drain.","ingredients":[{"id":11052,"name":"green beans","image":"green-beans-or-string-beans.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":3,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Heat the EVOO in a large, deep skillet over medium to medium-high heat, add the mushrooms and lightly brown them, 7 to 8 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11260,"name":"mushrooms","image":"mushrooms.png"},{"id":1034053,"name":"extra virgin olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}],"length":{"number":7,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"Add the butter, shallots and garlic, season with salt, pepper and thyme, and stir 2 to 3 minutes more.","ingredients":[{"id":11677,"name":"shallot","image":"shallots.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","image":"pepper.jpg"},{"id":2049,"name":"thyme","image":"thyme.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Add the flour, stir a minute, add the wine, stir in the stock and thicken.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Add the cream and Boursin and reduce the heat to simmer.","ingredients":[{"id":99188,"name":"boursin cheese","image":"cream-cheese.jpg"},{"id":1053,"name":"cream","image":"fluid-cream.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":6,"step":"Add the green beans and chicken and thicken a bit; stir in the tarragon.","ingredients":[{"id":11052,"name":"green beans","image":"green-beans-or-string-beans.jpg"},{"id":2041,"name":"tarragon","image":"tarragon.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":7,"step":"Transfer into a casserole dish and cool.

To prepare the steamer, place an upturned saucer into a large saucepan big enough to fit the pudding basin. This will act as a trivet to stop the base of the pudding coming into direct contact with the heat. Put the kettle on.\nIn a bowl, beat the butter and sugar until light and creamy. Slowly add the beaten eggs, mixing well between each addition. Add the vanilla and melted chocolate and mix everything well. Sieve the cocoa, flour and baking powder into the mixture, then fold in the ground almonds, milk and chocolate buttons.\nFill the pudding basin with the mixture. Cut out large circles of greaseproof paper and tin foil, big enough to fit over the basin with a 2-in overhang. Lightly butter the greaseproof and lay this on top of the foil, buttered side up. Make a pleat down the centre of the two, then place, paper side down, over the pudding. Turn the foil under to cover the paper. Secure well with string and lower the pudding into the steamer. Add enough boiling water from the kettle to come halfway up the basin but not touch the paper. Cover with a lid and turn the heat down to a gentle simmer.\nAfter 1 hr 15 mins, remove the lid and check the pudding is cooked by inserting a metal skewer. There should be no raw cake mixture on the skewer.\nMeanwhile, bubble the orange juice, jam, star anise and dried fruit together until syrupy. Stir in the maraschino and canned cherries.\nCarefully turn the pudding out on to a serving plate.

Cut the tenderloin into 3 equal pieces.Add all but ¼ cup of the salsa to a gallon-sized Ziploc bag, along with the Worcestershire sauce and balsamic vinegar; squish the marinade ingredients around a bit to combine. Add pork to Ziploc bag, turning to coat the pork in marinade. Squeeze out any excess air and seal the bag. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours to overnight.Prepare charcoal for grilling according to package instructions {or heat your gas grill to medium}. Grab your pork and onion slices and head out to the grill. Place pork and onions over very hot grill – if the grill gets too cool, remove food and add more charcoal {this was so me}. Cook for 10 minutes until pork is browned and has grill marks and onions are browning. Turn pork and onions, baste everything generously with more marinade, and cook for 5 more minutes. A meat thermometer inserted in the pork should read 150 degrees F before you remove it from the grill. Place pork on a cutting board and tent with foil.Chop onions and place in a bowl. Add reserved salsa, peaches, parsley, lemon zest, and avocado. Toss gently to combine; season with salt as needed. Cut pork into thin slices and serve with lots of salsa.Prepare charcoal for grilling according to package instructions {or heat your gas grill to medium}. Grill corn, poblano, and tomatillos until browned on all sides {pepper and tomatillos with blister and pop a little}. Place pepper and tomatillos in a bowl, immediately cover with plastic wrap, and set aside for 5 minutes.Once corn is cool enough to handle, cut kernels off cob. remove peppers and tomatillos from bowl, and using your fingers remove the skins. Halve the pepper and seed it; dice finely. Dice the tomatillos being sure to capture the juices. Add tomatillos (with juices), diced poblano pepper, red onion, cilantro, and salt to bowl with corn. Slightly smash the avocados and add to the rest of the ingredients. Mix until well combined.

For the chicken stock: Place the chicken bones, garlic, celery, carrots, onions, parsley, salt, peppercorns, cloves and bay leaves in a 10-quart or larger pressure cooker. Pour in about 16 cups water to just cover ingredients by 1 inch. Add more water if necessary but do not fill more than two-thirds of the pot. Cover and lock the lid. Bring to pressure according to manufacturer's instructions. (If the cooker has two levels of pressure, cook on the lowest.) Adjust the heat to maintain pressure, and cook for 45 minutes.                          Let the pressure subside by itself (natural method), or if in a rush, run cold water over the lid for a few minutes.                          Strain the liquid through a colander lined with layers of cheesecloth. Discard the solids.                          Cool uncovered and refrigerate overnight until the fat floats and solidifies. Remove the fat and save a small amount for matzo balls.                          Storage: Refrigerate up to 4 days. Important to bring to a rolling boil for at least 1 minute before using. Freeze up to 6 months.                          For the matzo balls: In a mixing bowl, whisk together the seltzer, schmaltz, salt, pepper and eggs. Then in a separate bowl, add the baking soda to the matzo meal and mix together. Next, add the matzo meal mixture into the egg mixture while stirring to a loose consistency. It will look watery, like a loose porridge. If it becomes too thick, either don't add the full amount of matzo meal or add a bit more seltzer. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.                          Fill a large pot with water and salt and bring to a simmer. With wet hands, roll out balls and gently drop to the water. Simmer until tender, light and fluffy in the center, 45 to 60 minutes. (To test centers, insert a toothpick, which should slide easily all the way through.) Allow to cool in the water undisturbed. Refrigerate in the cooking liquid or transfer to chicken soup.

Keep the stock warm while making the risotto.\n\nCook shallots and garlic: Melt a tablespoon of butter in a wide saucepan on medium heat. Add the chopped shallots and cook until translucent, a couple of minutes.\nAdd the minced garlic and cook until fragrant, a half minute more.\n\nLightly brown the rice: Add the risotto rice to the pan and toss to coat with the shallots. Increase the heat to medium high and let the rice start to brown.\n\nAdd the white wine: Stir in the white wine. The pan will steam up. Let the rice absorb the wine.\n\nStart adding the stock, 1/2 cup at a time: Here is the real process of making risotto. Add the stock, a half cup or ladleful at a time, slowly stirring the rice, and allowing the rice to absorb the stock for a minute or two, before adding another ladleful of stock.\n\nYou'll want to stop adding the stock when the rice is cooked through, but still a little firm to the bite, \"al dente\". Note that you may not need all of the stock you have heated for this recipe.\n\nAdd balsamic, tomatoes, thyme with last 1/2 cup of stock: When it comes time for that last 1/2 cup of stock to add to the risotto, add it, as well as the balsamic vinegar. Balsamic vinegar can vary in its acidity and intensity. So, add 1 tablespoon to start, and add another tablespoon if you want more of the balsamic flavor.\nAdd half of the cherry tomatoes and add the thyme. Let the tomatoes soften with the cooking of the risotto in those last few minutes.\n\nRemove from heat, stir in Parm: When the risotto has reached it's \"al dente\" stage, remove it from heat. Stir in the shredded Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle with pepper.\n\nServe: Serve with remaining halved fresh cherry tomatoes and thinly sliced basil on top.\n ","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat the stock: Bring 4 cups of stock to a low simmer in a small pot.

Wrap tightly first in plastic wrap and then in foil, and freeze for up to 2 weeks.                          To reheat in a microwave: Wrap the frozen burrito in parchment paper and microwave on high until hot in the center, 4 to 5 minutes.                          For the crunchy oven method: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Spray each side of the burrito generously with cooking spray and place seam-side down on a baking sheet. Cook until golden and crispy on the outside and hot inside, turning about halfway through, 25 to 30 minutes.
