hook). Let stand for 5 minutes. In a separate bowl, combine whole-wheat flour, 1 c. all-purpose flour, spices, pumpkin, and next 5 ingredients (salt through cloves). Set aside.    Add pumpkin, milk, butter, and 1 T. granulated sugar to yeast mixture. Beat gently until combined. Gradually add dry ingredients, mixing at medium speed until smooth. Turn dough out onto a floured surface (or fit your stand mixer with the dough hook). Knead dough until smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes).    Add enough of the remaining 3/4 c. flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough no longer sticks to your hands. The dough should still feel tacky. (I found I needed nearly the full amount.)     Place the dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place for 45 minutes or until doubled in size. An unheated oven is a great location for this. (To tell if the dough has risen enough: Press two fingers into the dough. If an indentation remains, the dough is ready).    To prepare filling: Combine 3 T. granulated sugar, brown sugar, 2 T. flour, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender or 2 knives until mixture resembles coarse meal. (Fingers work well too.)    Punch dough down; cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Roll into a 12 x 10-in. rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Sprinkle with brown sugar mixture, ensuring you go all the way to the edge.    Roll up the rectangle tightly, starting with a long edge (you are creating a 12 in. log). Press firmly as you go to eliminate air pockets. Pinch edge seam and roll ends to seal. Cut roll into 12 (1-in.) slices.    Arrange the rolls in a greased 9-in. square or round baking pan. Cover pan and let rise 25 minutes or until doubled in size. If you are preparing the rolls the night before: At this step, instead of letting rise for 25 minutes at room temperature, cover pan with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator to rise overnight. Let stand 1 hour at room temperature before baking.    Preheat oven to 375°. Bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 15 minutes in pan on a wire rack.

Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and generously butter the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Wrap the outside with aluminum foil, covering the bottom and extending all the way up the sides.2. In a small bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together.3. Beat the egg yolks in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high for 3 minutes. With the mixer running, slowly add 2 tablespoons of the sugar and beat until thick, light yellow ribbons form, about 5 minutes more. Beat in the extracts.4. Sift the flour mixture over the batter and stir it in by hand, just until no more white flecks appear. Now, blend in the melted butter.5. Now, wash the mixing bowl and beaters really well (if even a little fat is left, this can cause the egg whites not to whip). Put the egg whites and cream of tartar into the bowl and beat with the mixer on high until frothy. Gradually add the remaining sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form (the whites will stand up and look glossy, not dry). Fold about one-third of the whites into the batter, then the remaining whites. Don’t worry if you still see a few white specks, as they’ll disappear during baking.6. Gently spread out the batter over the bottom of the pan, and bake just until set and golden (not wet or sticky), about 10 minutes. Touch the cake gently in the center. If it springs back, it’s done. Watch carefully and don’t let the top brown. Leave the crust in the pan and place on a wire rack to cool. Leave the oven on while you prepare the cheesecake batter.Make the cheesecake7. Dissolve the instant espresso in the hot water in a small cup and let stand. Put one package of the cream cheese, 1/3 cup of the sugar, and the cornstarch in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on low until creamy, about 3 minutes, scraping the bowl down several times. Blend in the remaining cream cheese, one package at a time, scraping down the bowl after each one. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat in the remaining 1 1/3 cups sugar, then the vanilla.8. Blend in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after adding each one. Stir the dissolved coffee into the cream, then beat into the cream cheese mixture just until completely blended. Be careful not to overmix! Gently spoon the batter on top of the cooled sponge cake crust.9. Place the cake in a large shallow pan containing hot water that comes about 1 inch up the sides of the springform. Bake until the edges are light golden brown and the top is light tan, about 1 1/4 hours. Remove the cheesecake from the water bath, transfer to a wire rack, and let the cake cool for 2 hours (just walk away — don’t move it). Leave the cake in the pan, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until completely cold, preferably overnight or at least 4 hours.10. To decorate, release and remove the sides of the springform, leaving the cake on the bottom of the pan. Place on a cake plate. Cover the top with chocolate curls and dust with cocoa. Decorate the center of the cake with a few coffee beans if you wish (be sure to remove them before serving). Refrigerate until ready to serve.

Grigio, Riesling, and Sauvignon Blanc.

A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":5,"score":0.8175000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fattems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014%2F160114"}]},"instructions":"Bring

Butter three 9x2-inch round cake pans and line each with a parchment round. Butter the parchment, then dust with flour and knock out the excess.      In a 3-quart saucepan, combine the butter, oil, chopped chocolate, and 1 cup water. Heat over medium heat until melted.      In a large bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, and cocoa powder. Pour the hot chocolate mixture into the sugar mixture and whisk until combined.Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, then whisk in the buttermilk, vanilla, baking soda, and salt. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans.      Set two pans on the top rack and the third on the lower rack. Stagger the pans on the oven racks so that no pan is directly over another. Bake, swapping and rotating the pans positions after 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool on racks for 10 minutes. Invert the cakes onto the racks, remove the parchment, and cool completely.        Make the frosting    In a 4-quart saucepan over low heat, combine the cream, butter, and vanilla bean and seeds and stir until the butter is melted. Remove the vanilla bean and whisk in the chopped chocolate until melted. Whisk in the sugar, cocoa powder, syrup, and salt until smoothbe sure the cocoa powder dissolves completely. Pour into a 9x13-inch pan and freeze until firm, about 2 hours, or refrigerate overnight.    Make the marshmallows          Pour 3/4 cup cold water into the bowl of a stand mixer. Sprinkle the gelatin over the water. Attach the bowl to the mixer and fit it with the whisk attachment.      Clip a candy thermometer to a 3-quart saucepan; dont let the tip of the thermometer touch the bottom of the pan. In the saucepan, boil the sugar, corn syrup, salt, and 3/4 cup water over medium heat without stirring until it reaches 234F to 235F, about 10 minutes. With the mixer on low speed, pour the hot sugar mixture into the gelatin in a slow, thin stream.      Add the vanilla, carefully increase the speed to high, and beat until the mixture has thickened and cooled, about 5 minutes (the bottom of the bowl should be just warm to the touch). Line a 9x13-inch pan with foil, leaving an overhang on 2 sides. Sift 1 Tbs. of the confectioners sugar into the bottom of the pan, then pour the marshmallow mixture into the pan and sift another 1 Tbs. confectioners sugar on top. Let sit at room temperature until set, at least 2 hours.        Assemble the cake          Remove the frosting from the freezer or refrigerator. Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed for 2 minutes to soften. Change to a whisk attachment and beat at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.      Put a cake layer on a flat serving platter or a cake stand lined with strips of waxed paper to keep it clean while icing. Top the layer with 1-1/2 cups of the frosting, spreading it evenly with an offset spatula to the cakes edge. Repeat with another cake layer and 1-1/2 cups frosting. Top with the last cake layer.      Put 1-1/2 cups of the frosting in a small bowl. With an offset spatula, spread this frosting in a thin layer over the top and sides of the cake. Refrigerate the cake until the frosting firms enough to seal in the crumbs, 20 to 30 minutes.      Spread the remaining frosting in a smooth layer over the top and sides of the cake. If necessary, you can rewhip the remaining frosting to loosen and lighten it. Remove the waxed paper strips.      Use the foil overhang to lift the marshmallow from the pan. Using a knife that has been dipped in cold water, cut along the edge of the marshmallow to release it from the foil. Transfer to a cutting board and remove the foil. Put the remaining 1 cup confectioners sugar in a medium bowl. Cut the marshmallow into cubes of different sizes, from 1/4 to 3/4 inch (you will need to continue to dip the knife in cold water as you cut the marshmallows). The marshmallows will be very stickydip the cut edges in the confectioners sugar to make them easier to handle. As you work, toss a few cubes at a time in the sugar to coat, then shake in a strainer to remove the excess. Mound the marshmallows on top of the cake (youll need only a third to half of them). Sift some cocoa powder over the marshmallows.        Make Ahead Tips    You can bake, cool, wrap, and store the cake layers at room temperature for up to 1 day or freeze for up to 1 month. You can refrigerate the frosting for up to 3 days. The assembled cake can be refrigerated for up to 4 hours (return to room temperature before serving). Wrapped well, leftover marshmallows keep at room temperature for up to 1 month.                  nutrition information (per serving):        Calories                        (kcal):                      1080, Fat                        (kcal):                      47, Fat Calories                        (g):                      420, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      23, Protein                        (g):                      14, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      17, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      161, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      4.5, Sodium                        (g):                      350, Cholesterol                        (g):                      130, Fiber                        (g):                      8,                     Photo: Scott Phillips          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the cake","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Position racks in the bottom and top thirds of the oven and heat the oven to 350F.

Sprinkle any remaining cinnamon/sugar mixture and 1/3 cup crushed pecans over the top of the loaf.Sauce: In a small saucepan over medium heat, mix together the brown sugar, orange juice and butter and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and pour the mixture over the top of the biscuits in the pan. Bake for 25 minutes or until the center of the loaf is cooked through. Remove and cool slightly before removing from pan. If it starts to get too brown before the loaf is cooked through, cover with foil.Icing: In a small bowl, whisk together the cream cheese, 2 teaspoons orange juice, vanilla, and powdered sugar until smooth and creamy. If the icing is too thick, add small amounts of orange juice until you obtain the desired consistency. Drizzle over the bread while the bread is still warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
