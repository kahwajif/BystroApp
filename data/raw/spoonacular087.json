What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.\n\nQuintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

Line two 12-cup cupcake pans with 14 cupcake liners.                          In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the water, oil, vinegar, vanilla, and sweet potato until smooth. Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture and mix until just combined. Do not overmix.                          Fill the cupcake liners about two-thirds full with the batter. Bake for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean with a few crumbs clinging to it. Cool the cupcakes completely before frosting.                          For the coconut whipped cream: Chill the bowl and whisk of a stand mixer in the freezer for about 10 minutes. If they are not very cold, the cream will not whip properly.

You can use ribeye, strip or sirloin steak for this recipe. I used sirloin this time, but any of them will work. Choose steaks that are very thick. The thicker the steak the more juicy it will be. Cut the steak into 1\" - 2\" pieces.Add the soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, red wine, Worcestershire sauce, minced garlic, olive oil and salt and ground black pepper to taste. Mix everything to combine. You can grill the kebabs right away, letting the meat marinate while you prep the rest of the ingredients, but you can also marinate it a day in advance, just keep it refrigerated and then bring it to room temperature for 30 minutes before grilling it.Meanwhile, place the potatoes into a medium pot and add just enough water to cover the potatoes. Bring the potatoes to a boil and cook for another 5 minutes or so, just so that the potatoes can be pierced with a paring knife, but are still firm and hold their shape. Drain the potatoes.While the potatoes are cooking, combine the rest of the ingredients, olive oil, garlic, fresh and dry herbs, and salt and ground black pepper in a large mixing bowl.Add the drained, still hot potatoes to the bowl and mix it all to combine, so that the potatoes are completely coated in the garlic, herb and seasoning mixture. Since the potatoes are still hot, the potatoes will absorb some of the salt and all the other flavors more than if you would mix it all together when the potatoes have cooled. You can make the potatoes in advance as well as the steak. After seasoning the cooked potatoes, cool them completely and store in a covered container in the refrigerator until you are ready to grill the kebabs.For the mushrooms, I like to keep them whole, so I look for medium sized mushrooms. If the mushrooms are really big, you can cut them in half. Don't season the mushrooms in advance though. I like to toss them together with the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, herbs, salt and pepper right before threading everything onto skewers, that way they are still nice and firm. The longer the mushrooms stand in the marinade, the mushier and soggier they will be.Thread the steak, potatoes and mushrooms onto your skewers. I ended up getting 6 kebabs with meat, potatoes and mushrooms and 2 kebabs with just potatoes and mushrooms, but that was intentional. I like having extra potatoes and mushrooms:). If you want to have more meat, use 1 lbs of steak meat. (I used only 1 lb for the 6 kebabs.)Preheat the grill for 15 minutes, then clean the grill and brush it several times with a paper towel soaked in oil.Place the kebabs on the hot grill and cook, covered, for 6-8 minutes per side. If you cook the kebabs for 8 minutes per side, the meat will be well done. We like our steak to be medium, so we cook them for about 6 minutes per side. The time also depends on how thick your meat is cut. If they are 1\", of course they will cook quicker than if you cut them into 2\" pieces.I like to garnish the kebabs with more fresh herbs when they are done cooking.

You can make the potatoes in advance as well as the steak. After seasoning the cooked potatoes, cool them completely and store in a covered container in the refrigerator until you are ready to grill the kebabs.For the mushrooms, I like to keep them whole, so I look for medium sized mushrooms. If the mushrooms are really big, you can cut them in half. Don't season the mushrooms in advance though. I like to toss them together with the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, herbs, salt and pepper right before threading everything onto skewers, that way they are still nice and firm. The longer the mushrooms stand in the marinade, the mushier and soggier they will be.Thread the steak, potatoes and mushrooms onto your skewers. I ended up getting 6 kebabs with meat, potatoes and mushrooms and 2 kebabs with just potatoes and mushrooms, but that was intentional. I like having extra potatoes and mushrooms:).

Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar until fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, being sure to scrape down the edges after adding each egg. Beat in the vanilla. In another bowl, combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and pumpkin spice. Slowly beat the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Once mixed, turn the mixer off and gently fold in the pumpkin puree. Scoop batter equally into the cake pans and level with a knife. Bake in preheated oven for 35 - 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and allow to cool for several minutes. Gently remove the cake from the pans and place on a cooling rack. Make the cream cheese frosting filling by creaming together the butter and cream cheese. Beat in the vanilla. Beat in the powered sugar and mix until a stiff but spreadable mixture forms. Place one of the cakes bottom side up on a cake stand. Spread the cream cheese frosting over the top. Place the other cake, top side up, on top of the frosting. Make the ganache right before you are ready to use it, by heating the heavy cream in a saucepan just until simmering. Place the chocolate chips in a bowl you can easily pour from (I used my 4 cup measuring cup). Pour the hot cream over the top. Make sure all of the chocolate is submerged in the cream. Let stand for two minutes. Gently whisk the chocolate and cream together until the chocolate has melted and the mixture has a glossy look to it. Carefully, and working from the center outward, pour the chocolate ganache over the cake. The ganache will be thick, you can use a knife to spread it around. Do this quickly before the ganache hardens. Note: Some of the ganache may pool on the serving platter. You can remove it with a spoon and then wipe the platter with a paper towel. Or leave it :) After ganache hardens, about 15 minutes you can slice and serve the cake. Keep any leftovers in the refrigerator. Remove from the fridge about an hour before serving to allow the cake to come to room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes.

Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8073684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Ffonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998%2F12434"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.Toss cauliflower with oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl.

Heat a grill pan or outdoor grill to high heat.                          Peel up the taters and cut them into small chunks. Place potatoes in a pot and cover with cold water. Cover the pot and bring up to a boil over high heat. Uncover, add salt to season up the potatoes and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.                          In a small pot over medium low heat and add vegetable oil, about 1 tablespoon  just eyeball it. Add 2 tablespoons butter in small pieces. When butter melts into oil, add 4 cloves of chopped garlic. Saute garlic 1 to 2 minutes, then add scallions and remove pan from heat and reserve.                          Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.                          In a large bowl, combine balsamic vinegar, Worcestershire, crushed red pepper flakes, rosemary then whisk in about 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, eyeball it. Turn portobello caps in marinade and transfer to a plate to reserve. Add chicken thighs to remaining marinade and coat evenly. Season 1 side of the chicken thighs, as well as the reserved mushroom caps with salt and pepper then transfer just the thighs to hot grill, seasoned side down. Season the opposite side of the chicken thighs and grill for 6 minutes on each side then transfer to a plate to rest. Add raw marinated mushroom caps to grill and top with a heavy skillet to press down on them as they grill. Cook 3 to 4 minutes on each side until, dark, tender and well-marked.                          While chicken thighs and mushrooms cook, add a tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, a turn of the pan, to hot skillet. Add remaining 2 cloves of garlic, peppers and onions to the skillet season with salt and pepper and cook, tossing frequently, 7 to 8 minutes. Add tomatoes and parsley to the pan and toss to heat through, about 1 minute then remove from heat.                          Thinly slice rested chicken thigh meat and grilled mushrooms.                          Drain potatoes then return them to the hot pot to evaporate some of the water content. Add the reserved garlic and scallion mixture to the potatoes along with the ricotta, 1/2 cup milk and grated cheese and smash away to combine potatoes with cheeses and milk. Season the super-mashers with salt and pepper.                          Pile up 1/4 of the potatoes on each plate. Top each pile with 1/4 of chicken, mushrooms and sauce and serve immediately.

Coat in flour and shake off any excess. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook undisturbed until it begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Continue to cook, turning the beef as needed, until mostly browned, about 3 minutes more. Remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the beef to the insert of a 6-quart slow cooker; add the potatoes, mushrooms, carrots and onions and stir to combine.

bowl, dissolve yeast in water and milk.  Add eggs, sugar, butter, salt and 3 cups flour; beat until smooth.  Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.  Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6-8 minutes.  Place in a grease bowl; turn once to grease top.

Brush with some butter; sprinkle with 2/3 cup filling.  Roll up, jelly roll-style, staring with a long side; pinch to seal.  Place on a greased baking sheet; shape top to form a cane.

Let sit for 10 minutes.*Note: You don’t need a stand mixer to make this recipe, but it will make things easier. Start with the standard paddle hook, but you’ll need the dough hook later.In another bowl, beat together eggs, salt and evaporated milk.Pour egg mixture into the yeast mixture and stir well.Add 3 cups of flour and mix on low or stir until combined.Add shortening or butter and continue adding the remaining 4 cups of flour slowly until it’s all incorporated. Dough will be sticky.At this point you can switch your mixer to the dough hook and beat on medium, adding more flour about a tablespoon at a time until the dough pulls away from the sides and forms a smooth ball (about 4-6 minutes). If you don’t have a mixer or would rather knead, place the dough on a floured surface and knead until smooth, adding a little more flour as needed (about 8-10 minutes). The dough may still be a bit sticky, but shouldn’t be overly so.Spray a bowl with cooking spray and place the dough inside. If the bowl doesn’t have a cover, lightly place some plastic wrap on top. Let rise for 2 hours in a warm spot. I like to turn my oven on to the lowest temperature for about a minute and then immediately turn it off again. Then I place the bowl in the warm oven.Dipping Sauce:In a microwave safe bowl, mix together butter, chocolate, and milk. Microwave in 30 seconds intervals, string until all the chocolate and butter is melted and the mixture is smooth. Store in the fridge or let sit out until beignets are ready. Warm it back up on the stove or in the microwave.When the dough is ready place the dough on a lightly floured surface and roll out into a square or rectangle. Roll to 1/8 inch thick. Use a knife or pastry cutter to cut into 3×3 inch squares (about 50 squares).Scoop out a scant teaspoon of chocolate hazelnut spread and place in the middle of square. Gently place another square on top and pinch the sides together. Fold each side in about 1/4 inch and pinch again. It is VERY important that the beignet is well sealed. If not, it could pop open while it fries and all the filling will spill out!*place a deep pot like a dutch oven on the stove and add enough oil to fill the pot about 1 to 1 1/2 inches deep.Turn the burner to medium and preheat to 350 degrees. I would recommend using an instant read thermometer so you know the exact temperature at all times. It will take about 10-15 minutes to heat up. If you don’t have a thermometer, you’ll know it’s ready when you sprinkle some flour in the pot and it sizzles. If it gets hotter than 350 or starts smoking, remove the pot from burner immediately and let it cool down to the correct temperature.Set several layers of paper towels near your pot. Fill a paper or plastic bag with powdered sugar and place that near the paper towels.When the dough is cut and the oil is at the correct temperature, add a dough square, one a time, to the pot with a slotted spoon. Fry 4-6 at time depending on the size of your pot. Be careful: if you add too many at once or you may wind up burning them. Use the slotted spoon to flip them over every 30 seconds. Fry for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown on both sides. If they are taking longer than 3 minutes to brown you need to turn your burner up and make sure your oil is at the correct temperature. Remove with slotted spoon and place on paper towels to drain. Let cool for a minute and then transfer to the bag of sugar. Hold the bag closed and toss to coat. Repeat with remaining squares.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Mix the yeast, sugar and water in a large mixer* bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"yeast-granules.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404726,"name":"blender","image":"blender.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Let sit for 10 minutes.*Note: You don’t need a stand mixer to make this recipe, but it will make things easier.
