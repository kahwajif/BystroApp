Set aside. Heat oven to 350F/180C.Cut 2 of the apples into -inch thick slices. Set aside. Cut the remaining 2 apples into -inch thick slices. Melt the butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium high heat. Add the -inch thick apple slices to the pan. Cook, stirring a few times, until the apples begin to caramelized, about 4-6 minutes. Stir in the -inch thick slices, brown sugar, lemon juice, and coffee creamer. Cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture coats all of the apples, about 1 minute more. Transfer the apples to the prepared baking pan, trying to leave as much of the juice as possible in the skillet. Press the apples into an even layer. Set aside.For the cake, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars and eggs until thick and well combined. Add in the butter until combined. Stir in the sour cream and vanilla. Add the flour mixture and mix until just combined. Pour the batter over the apples and spread evenly.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.2. Making the Filling: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm the oil until hot. Add the onion, green pepper and jalapeos, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.3. Reduce the heat to medium and add the ground beef to the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally to break up the meat, until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Once the meat is browned, add the onion mixture back to the pan. Stir in the corn, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, chili powder, cumin and salt. Stir well to ensure that the spices and the tomato paste are evenly distributed. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand while preparing the cornbread topping.4. Make the Cornbread Topping: Whisk together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk and melted butter. Pour the wet ingredients over the cornmeal mixture and stir together until barely incorporated.5. Assemble & Bake the Pie: Stir the olives and shredded cheese into the beef mixture and pour it into a 9x13-inch baking dish, smoothing the top. Pour the cornbread batter over the filling, using a spatula to spread it into an even layer. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the pie to rest for 15 minutes before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":375,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Making the Filling: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm the oil until hot.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the onion, green pepper and jalapeos, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11333,"name":"green pepper","image":"green-pepper.jpg"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":10,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Transfer to a bowl and set aside.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":5,"step":"Reduce the heat to medium and add the ground beef to the pan.

Add the egg, vegetable oil, and salt to the well and carefully beat together with a fork without incorporating the flour. Continue stirring with a wooden spoon, adding small amounts of the warm water, and gradually incorporating the flour. Only add the next bit of water when the last has been thoroughly blended with the flour and the mixture has become dry. Once the dough has begun to form, lose the spoon and knead the dough with your hands. Stop adding water once all the flour has been incorporated and a soft dough has formed (it should not feel wet or sticky—if it does, add a little more flour).                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Grab a kitchen timer and set it for 8 minutes. Continue to knead the dough until the timer goes off, dusting the work surface with flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking. It should be smooth and elastic. Invert a bowl over the dough and let it rest at room temperature for 1 hour.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            For the filling: Put the potatoes in a large saucepan filled with water, bring to a boil, and continue boiling until soft. Drain and place in a large mixing bowl.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            While the potatoes are cooking, fry the bacon in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until crispy. Remove the cooked bacon and drain on paper towels, but keep 1 or 2 tablespoons of the fat in the pan. Add the minced onion and cook in the bacon fat until it is soft and lightly browned. Add the peas and continue to cook until the peas are just cooked, about 2 minutes. Set aside.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Crumble the bacon and add it to the bowl with the potatoes, along with the cheese. Season generously with salt and pepper, and mash the ingredients together. We use a hand mixer set at a low speed. You can use a food processor if you wish, but be careful not to overprocess: The mixture should be somewhat lumpy—not creamy smooth. Fold in the peas and minced onions. Taste and correct for seasoning.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            To fill and cook the pierogi: Bring a large pot of salted to water to a boil.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface until about 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick. Cut circles 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) in diameter with either the rim of a glass or a cookie cutter. Spoon about 1 tbsp of filling in the center of each one, and fold the dough over the filling to make a half circle. (Don’t overfill, or the pierogi will become difficult to seal.) Crimp the edges with your fingers or the tines of a fork so they are well sealed (dampen the edges first if necessary).                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat in the same frying pan you used for the minced onion. Cook the sliced onions until soft and brown. Do not cook them too quickly; this should take 20 minutes or so. Reduce the heat to low if necessary. When done, set aside and keep them warm. You can cover them with foil and place in a warming oven, or an oven set on low heat.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Boil the pierogi in batches, for 5 minutes after they have floated to the surface of the water. Remove from the water with a slotted spoon and set aside on a large plate or platter.                                                                                                                            10                                                                            In a large frying pan, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat and lightly brown the cooked pierogi in batches—as many as will fit in the pan without crowding, turning once and adding more butter to the pan if necessary between batches. Transfer to a warm platter. Pour the cooked onions over the tops of the fried pierogi and serve with a bowl of the sour cream on the side for those who would like to dollop some of that on, too.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the pierogi dough: On a clean work surface, mound the flour and make a well in the center.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the egg, vegetable oil, and salt to the well and carefully beat together with a fork without incorporating the flour.

Gradually pour in the water, stirring the flour with a wooden spoon or chopsticks as you pour the flour.\nOnce the water is all absorbed by the flour, start kneading the dough together with your hands. When you have incorporated all the loose flour into the dough, turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough for another 6 to 7 minutes. The dough should be elastic and quite smooth on the top. To see if the dough has been kneaded enough, rip out a golf ball-sized piece of dough, and pull it apart gently, as if you are tugging the dough at 4 corners. You should be able to stretch the dough out enough so that the center is translucent without the dough ripping apart. One or two minor tears around your fingers is okay. Shape the dough into a ball.\nLightly grease a bowl with oil and place the ball of dough inside. Cover it with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for 1 hour. You can also refrigerate the dough overnight, which is what I prefer (see notes below for instructions).\n\nPrepare the Shallots\n\nHeat a tablespoon of canola oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook them for 2 to 3 minutes, until they start to soften.\nTurn off the heat and transfer the cooked shallots into a bowl.\n\nShape the Pancakes (use photos above for reference)\n\nTake the rested dough out of the bowl and divide it into 4 pieces, about 120g to 125g each. Shape each piece into a ball. Cover the balls of dough with a dry towel or piece of plastic wrap.\nLightly grease your work surface with oil (can be a large wooden board or marble slab). Roll out the dough into a thin rectangle. The dough should be thin enough that you can almost see the surface underneath. I never roll out a perfectly shaped rectangle, so do not worry if yours look lopsided. Also dont sweat about any small tears you might create when rolling out the dough.\nPour about 2 teaspoons of oil over the rolled out dough and use your hands to rub over the surface. Lightly dust the dough with about 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon five-spice powder (I used this dusting wand). Sprinkle a quarter of the cooked shallots and sliced scallions over the dough. Fold the dough into thirds: grab the bottom length of the dough and fold it over the center of the dough, leaving a third of the dough unfolded. Next, grab the top third of the dough and fold it down over the center. Give everything one more fold. Dont fold the dough too tightlya little bit of air in between the folds is perfectly fine. Gather the dough together and give it a little tug on the ends to stretch out the dough just a little.\nStarting from one end, start curling the dough, creating a snail-like shape. You can either tuck the other end underneath the curled up dough or lay it on top. Repeat for the other remaining balls of dough, making sure to grease the work surface again if necessary.\n\nCook the Pancakes\n\nLightly grease the work surface again. Take one of the curled up balls of dough and roll it out into a thin circle. The rolling might force out some of the shallots and scallions, and thats okay. It happens to me all the time.\nHeat a 12-inch skillet with 1 1/2 tablespoons of canola oil over medium-high heat. Transfer the pancake to the pan and cook it for 3 to 4 minutes, until the pancakes are golden brown, flipping about halfway through. Transfer the pancakes to a wire cooling rack. If you dont have a rack, transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate.\nWhile one pancake is cooking, roll out the next one. Add more oil to the pan and cook the remaining pancakes. These scallion pancakes are best consumed while theyre still warm. You can tear them apart or cut them into small wedges. Serve on their own or with your favorite dipping sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the Dough","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.

Lightly butter a 9-by-3-inch cake pan. Line the bottom with parchment paper; lightly butter parchment. Get out your cream cheese, eggs, and sour cream and let come to room temperature for at least and hour before you start baking (this is VERY important to ensuring your cheesecake is smooth and lump-free).For crust, crush cookies in a food processor until finely ground. You should have just over a cup of cookie crumbs. Add sugar and salt and pulse to combine. Drizzle in melted butter and pulse until crumbs are evenly moistened. Spread into bottom of prepared pan and press firmly into an even layer (use a tamper or a flat-bottomed glass to help pack the crumbs tightly). Place crust in freezer for 15 to 30 minutes to set while you prepare the filling.For filling, place cream cheese in bowl of food processor and pulse until smooth. Add sugar and pulse 2-3 times until combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.Whisk together flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder, and salt and add to bowl with cream cheese, pulsing once or twice to combine. Add eggs and egg yolk and pulse until just incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add vanilla and sour cream and pulse once or twice to blend.Place chocolate in a heat-proof bowl. Microwave on half-power for about 1 minute, stirring after every 15 seconds, until chocolate is mostly melted. Remove from microwave and continue to stir until completely melted and smooth, using the residual heat from the chocolate and the bowl to melt the chocolate the rest of the way.Slowly drizzle in chocolate through the feed tube of the food processor, pulsing as you go, until chocolate is incorporated and no white streaks remain in batter. Remove crust from freezer and pour batter into chilled crust.Bake for 55 to 60 minutes or until center is set but still barely jiggly. Gently run a thin knife around the edge of the cheesecake to release it from the sides (this will help prevent cracking). Turn off oven and prop door open with a wooden spoon; let cheesecake cool in oven for 1 hour, then remove and set on a wire rack to cool to room temperature. Once cool, run a knife around the edge of the cheesecake again to release it, then invert onto a plate. The parchment on the bottom should ensure the cake comes out cleanly. Invert again onto a serving plate. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight until firm (you can also glaze the cheesecake before refrigerating overnight, however your glaze will not be as soft or shiny after refrigeration).To prepare glaze, place chopped chocolate in a heat-proof bowl. Heat cream in a small saucepan until it just starts to bubble around the edges (do not let it boil). Pour cream over chopped chocolate and let sit for 30 seconds, then slowly whisk, working in concentric circles starting in the middle, until chocolate is fully melted and smooth. Add butter, one cube at a time, slowly whisking until melted and smooth.Pour glaze over top of cheesecake, spreading to edges with an offset spatula. Decorate as desired. Let set for about 1 hour, or refrigerate for 20 minutes or so until glaze is set.To slice, run a large knife under hot water for 30 seconds. Wipe try with a clean towel, then slice. Wipe your knife off after each slice, and run it under hot water again after every 2-3 slices. This will ensure your slices are clean and crisp.Cheesecake will keep, lightly covered in the refrigerator, for up to 3-5 days. Cheesecake can also be frozen, though I recommend freezing it naked and then glazing before serving for the prettiest presentation.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.

Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses.

Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set it aside. Place a medium-sized glass or metal mixing bowl in the freezer to chill for the whipped cream.To prepare the shortcake: In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Stir to combine.In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup or smaller mixing bowl, combine the coconut milk, honey and vanilla. Whisk to blend, then pour the wet mixture in to the dry.Mix with a big spoon until you have a cohesive dough. If the dough is sticky and unmanageable, let it rest for a few minutesif it's still being difficult, add another tablespoon of flour and stir just until incorporated.Lightly flour your work surface, and turn the dough over onto it. Knead the dough a few times, just enough to bring the dough together. Then, press the dough into a square shape about 1\" deep.Use a sharp chef's knife to slice the dough into 3 even columns and 3 even rows, to make 9 squares. Place the squares onto your prepared baking sheet, leaving a couple inches around each one. Brush the tops of the dough liberally with coconut milk, and sprinkle them with turbinado sugar, if using. Bake for 20 to 22 minutes, until they are firm to the touch.Meanwhile, prepare the coconut whipped cream: Open the can of chilled coconut milk or coconut cream, and scoop the solid white portion into your chilled bowl, leaving the watery part behind. With an electric hand mixer, beat until smooth and relatively fluffy. Add the honey and vanilla extract and blend to combine. Refrigerate until you're ready to serve.To prepare the strawberries: Place half of the sliced strawberries in a medium mixing bowl and mash them with a potato masher (or pastry cutter or big fork) until juicy. Add the remaining sliced strawberries and honey and stir to combine. Set aside until ready to serve.When you're ready to serve, carefully slice the shortcakes in half lengthwise with a paring knife. Top the lower halve of each shortcake liberally with sliced strawberries, followed by whipped cream. Top with the upper halve of the shortcake. If you want to make them extra decadent, add one more dollop of whipped cream and maybe a small strawberry on top.
