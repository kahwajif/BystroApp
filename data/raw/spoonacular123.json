powder, paprika, cayenne or hot sauce, Parmesan cheese, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Whisk to combine thoroughly. Slice the cold butter thinly into the dry ingredients and cut it in using your preferred method (fingers, pastry cutter, knives, fork, or mixer) until the mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle the orange juice over it and then stir in 2 to 3 tablespoons of cold cream, a tablespoon at a time. Work until the dough holds together; if you squeeze a handful of it, it should not fall apart.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Shape the dough into a disk 1 inch thick, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight. (Alternatively, put the freezer for a few hours instead, removing it to the refrigerator about 2 hours before planning to roll it out.) At least 30 minutes before you plan to assemble the quiche and put it in the oven, remove the dough from the refrigerator so that it can warm and soften a bit before rolling. When it is flexible enough, roll it out (I do this between two sheets of parchment) and fit it into a standard ceramic quiche dish or a 9-inch pie pan that is at least 1 1/4 inches deep. Trim any excess and refrigerate the crust until you are ready to fill it.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Heat 2 tablespoons reserved bacon fat in a skillet and fry the sliced leeks over low heat until they are soft but not mushy, about 10 minutes. Salt very lightly and remove with a slotted spoon. Add 2 more tablespoons bacon fat to the skillet and fry the tomato slices over medium heat for 2 minutes per side. Season with salt to taste. The leeks and tomatoes can be refrigerated until you are ready to fill the crust.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            To assemble and bake, preheat the oven to 425°F. Arrange the leeks and tomatoes in the crust. Whisk together the remaining cup of cream, the eggs, the remaining tablespoon of flour, a generous 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, the Swiss cheese, and the crumbled bacon. Pour this mixture over the leeks and tomatoes.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Bake for 10 minutes at 425°F. Turn the oven down to 350°F, shield the crust with a piece of aluminum foil, and cook 25 minutes more. When the quiche is done, a knife inserted an inch from its edge should emerge wet but clean. Serve lukewarm, not hot, and keep leftovers in the refrigerator.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Put the whole wheat pastry flour and 1/4 cup of the all-purpose flour in a bowl with the baking powder, paprika, cayenne or hot sauce, Parmesan cheese, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.","ingredients":[{"id":10020080,"name":"whole wheat pastry flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":1033,"name":"parmesan","image":"parmesan.jpg"},{"id":2031,"name":"ground cayenne pepper","image":"chili-powder.jpg"},{"id":2028,"name":"paprika","image":"paprika.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Whisk to combine thoroughly.

Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio.

A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":5,"score":0.8175000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fattems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014%2F160114"}]},"instructions":"In a large bowl, stir the black bean sauce, oyster sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil, and rice vinegar.

Mix with a spoon, then let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add in 2 1/2 cups flour and salt, stirring with a spoon until the dough comes together but is still sticky. Using your hands, form the dough into a ball and work in the additional 1/2 cup flour, kneading it on a floured surface for a few minutes. Rub the same bowl with olive oil then place the dough inside, turning to coat. Cover with a towel and place in a warm place to rise for about 1-1 1/2 hours.After the dough has risen, punch it down and place it back on the floured surface. Using a rolling pin or your hands, form it into your desired shape (sometimes I use baking sheets and do rectangles or free form pizzas - this specific dough will yield one pizza large enough to feed about 3-4 people) and place on a baking sheet or pizza peel. Place the towel back over the dough and let sit in the warm place for 10 minutes.While the pizza is rising, heat the broiler in your oven to high. Season the chicken thighs with the chipotle powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Place them on a baking sheet and stick it under the broiler. Broil for 7 minutes, then flip, broiling for 7 minutes more. In a small bowl, whisk together the honey, vinegar and 1 teaspoon of the adobo sauce. Brush it on the chicken thighs and broil for another minute. Flip the chicken and brush the remaining mixture on the other side, broiling for 1 more minute.Remove the chicken and shred it once cooled.Heat theoven to 425 degrees. (If I use my pizza stone, I heat my oven to 475 degrees and bake for 15 minutes. If you're just using a baking sheet, follow the directions below for baking and set to 425 degrees.)Brush the pizza dough edges with olive oil. Spread the marinara sauce on the dough and swirl in the remaining teaspoon of adobo sauce. Add half of the fontina on the sauce. Cover the fontina with the shredded chicken, green chiles, scallions, corn and crumbled goat cheese. Add the remaining fontina on top.Bake for 20 to 25 minutes (or around 15 to 20 minutes if using the pizza stone) until the cheese is golden and bubbly. Remove and top with the fresh cilantro.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, mix the flour, baking powder, sugar, cardamom, and salt on low speed until well mixed.    Add the butter and mix until the mixture resembles cornmeal, about 5 minutes.    Mix in the condensed milk mixture all at once and continue mixing until it is fully incorporated and the dough forms a ball around the paddle.    Transfer to a large sheet of plastic wrap, pat into a 1-inch-thick disk, and wrap tightly in the plastic.    Refrigerate for 20 minutes.    Preheat the oven to 300 F.    Break off a ball of dough with the diameter of a dime (a tiny piece).  Roll the dough into a five inch long snake.  Try to make the snake fairly thin, but with enough thickness that you can still pick it up and move it without it breaking.    Transfer the snake to a parchment- or Silpat-lined baking sheet (or just roll it directly on the sheet if that's easier for you) and repeat with the remaining dough, setting the sticks 1/2 inch apart.    Refrigerate the baking sheets, uncovered, for 10 minutes.    Brush the dough snakes with the egg white and bake until golden brown and crisp.  Check on them at 20 minutes, but depending on how thick you made them, it may take 25 minutes.    Cool completely.    Melt white chocolate in a double boiler or using short intervals in the microwave.  Stir until smooth.    Divide melted chocolate into three tall shot glasses.    Add red food coloring to one of the shot glasses.  If the chocolate is no longer smooth and liquidy, add a little vegetable oil at a time to the red chocolate until the consistency is good for dipping.    Add blue food coloring to another one of the shot glasses.  If the chocolate is no longer smooth and liquidy, add a little vegetable oil at a time to the red chocolate until the consistency is good for dipping.    One at a time, dip 1/3 of the Pocky sticks in the plain white chocolate. Set each one back on the lined cookie sheet when done.    Repeat with the other two colors.    Refrigerate until just before serving to harden the chocolate.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Mix the sweetened condensed milk with water and set aside.

recipe.                    In a small bowl combine the lemon juice and zest, chopped herbs, garlic, crushed red pepper, and 1/2 cup of olive oil. Whisk to combine.                          Place the chicken thighs in a wide flat dish so they are in a single layer. Add the herb mixture. Massage the thighs to coat with the herb mixture. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Note: If doing a quick marinade, leave the chicken out of the fridge for up to 1 hour.                          Preheat grill. Brush and oil the grill to clean.                          Remove the chicken from the marinade and brush off any excess herbs and oil. Season the chicken generously with salt and drizzle with a little bit of fresh olive oil.                          Cut the 2 whole lemons in half and cut the tips off the ends; this will allow the lemons to stand up without rolling around. Place the chicken, skin side down, on the preheated grill. Place the lemons, flesh side down, on the preheated grill. Grill the chicken for 3 to 4 minutes and then rotate the chicken 90 degrees to create the lovely crosshatch pattern. Grill the chicken for another 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the chicken over and grill for another 4 to 5 minutes. Check for doneness (the chicken should be well cooked). Check the lemon halves to see if they are beautifully caramelized. Turn over to grill on the bottom for 2 to 3 minutes.                          Serve the chicken with grilled lemon.                          Call yourself a superstar!
