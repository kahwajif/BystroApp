325 degrees F. Spread the pecans evenly on a silicone mat on a baking sheet. Place in the oven and bake until toasted, 7 to 10 minutes. Combine the sugar, brown sugar, salt, cream, light corn syrup and butter in a small saucepan and stir constantly over low heat until the sugars dissolve. Add the baking soda, and increase the heat to medium-high, stirring constantly. Cook the caramel to 244 degrees F. Immediately dip the bottom of the hot pan in an ice bath to stop the cooking of the caramel. Add the vanilla and rum. Scoop the caramel over the toasted pecans so that the caramel is splotchy all over the nuts. Let cool to room temperature. For the coffee ganache: In a small saucepan over medium heat, caramelize the sugar to a dark amber. Heat the cream, fleur de sel, and ground espresso in the microwave until it's hot to the touch, 1 to 2 minutes. Carefully add the espresso cream to the cooked sugar and bring it back to a boil. Be very careful this point because the sugar will bubble up as soon as the cream comes in contact with the sugar. Just keep pouring the cream in slowly and stirring the entire time. Place the chocolate, honey, butter, and coffee liqueur in a large bowl. Strain the caramel over the chocolate. Let sit for 30 seconds, and then whisk to combine. Let stand at room temperature until the edges start to crystallize. For the pistachio ganache: In a small saucepan, bring the cream and light corn syrup to a boil. Place the butter, white chocolate, and pistachio compound in a small bowl. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate. Let stand for 10 seconds, and then whisk to combine. Fold in the chopped pistachios. Let stand at room temperature until the edges start to crystallize. Pipe into the other half of the chocolate shell dome. For the chocolate domes: Melt the coating chocolate and pour into the mold, let it sit for 30 seconds, and pour back out. Let it completely crystallize. Repeat with all the molds. Pipe the coffee ganache into the chocolate molds. Glue the 2 halves together with melted coating chocolate.

Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8073684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Ffonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998%2F12434"}]},"instructions":"Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil in a large enameled cast iron pot over medium-high heat.

Set asideIn the bowl of a stand mixer cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and beat to combine. Add the flour on low speed alternately with a little milk, beginning and ending with flour just until the dough comes together. Divide into two equal portions, flatten slightly, wrap in plastic wrap and chill while you make the peppermint dough. At this point the dough can be refrigerated for up to 4 days or frozen for 2 months. Whisk together the flour and salt. Set aside. Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolk and beat to combine. Add the peppermint extract and food coloring. Reduce mixer speed to low and begin adding the flour one large spoonful at a time. Add the next scoop when the first is almost incorporated. Mix only until combined. Divide into two equal portions, flatten slightly, wrap in plastic wrap and chill while you roll out the chocolate dough. At this point the dough can be refrigerated for up to 4 days or frozen for 2 months. Roll out each portion of the chocolate dough into a rectangle on a lightly floured surface until it is 1/8th inch thick. Transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet and chill 1 hour or overnight. Roll out each portion of the peppermint dough into a rectangle on a lightly floured surface until it is 1/8th inch thick. Transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet and chill 1 hour or overnight. To make a swirl: Trim the dough into two rectangles of similar size. Save the scraps.  Temper the dough for about 10 minutes at room temperature or until it is flexible. Orient the chocolate dough so the long side is closest to you and the edge of the counter. Place the peppermint on top of the chocolate (the bottom/outside dough should still be on the parchment) but leave about 1/8th inch overhang of the chocolate. In other words you should see 1/8th inch of the chocolate dough peeking out from under the peppermint. Begin to roll the chocolate over the peppermint  rolling away from you. Once you start the roll, use the parchment to guide the dough. This will limit the cracks in the exterior. Once you roll all the way up, close the roll and refrigerate. Repeat with the remaining two rectangles. Refrigerate overnight. To make a Marble: Combine all the scraps from the swirls and roll into a log in parchment. Refrigerate overnight. Preheat oven to 350F. Slice the logs into  inch slices and place 1 inch apart on parchment lined baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven 5-7 minutes or until the edges begin to brown and the centers are matte.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt.

For mom's flaky pie dough: Combine the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor and pulse until combined. Gradually add the butter chunks and pulse until the largest chunks are pea-size. Add the ice water 1 tablespoon at a time and pulse just until the dough begins to clump together against the walls of the processor. Dump the dough out onto a work surface and press together to make a cohesive ball, kneading once or twice if it is falling apart. Divide the dough in half, wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 portion of the dough for 1 hour before using. (You'll be using only 1 portion of dough for the pie, so wrap the extra piece in a second layer of plastic wrap, put in a resealable plastic bag and freeze for another time.)                          On a well-floured surface with a well-floured rolling pin, roll the dough into a 9- to 10-inch round and transfer to an 8-inch pie plate. (If the rolling pin and work surface quickly become sticky, refrigerate the dough until firm, or, using a large spatula or bench scraper, transfer the dough to an 8-inch pie plate and press it into shape.) Crimp the edges and prick the bottom all over with a fork. Refrigerate the pie shell for 20 minutes.                          Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.                          Place a sheet of parchment paper or foil in the pie shell and fill with pie weights, raw rice or dried beans. Bake until the edges are lightly golden, about 15 minutes. Remove the weights and paper and bake until golden and cooked on the bottom and sides, about 15 minutes more. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F.                          For the pumpkin pie filling: Combine the pumpkin, cream, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves and salt in a large bowl and whisk until thoroughly blended. Stir in the bourbon, vanilla and eggs. Whisk again until thoroughly blended.                          Pour the pumpkin mixture into the pie shell and smooth the top with an offset spatula. Bake until the center wobbles slightly when shaken, 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes. Cool completely on a rack for about 2 hours. Serve with Cinnamon-Buttermilk Whipped Cream.                          Add the heavy cream and buttermilk to a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer until foamy. Gradually add the sugar and cinnamon while beating, then continue to beat until soft peaks form.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]}]},{"name":"For mom's flaky pie dough","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor and pulse until combined.

Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":452761,"title":"Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio","description":"Pinot Grigio Ramato continues a tradition of the Republic of Venice, since “ramato”, or coppery, was the term referred to Pinot Grigio in contracts. A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue. Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":5,"score":0.8175000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fattems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014%2F160114"}]},"instructions":"<ol><li><span class=\"recipe-directions__list--item\">In a sauce pan over medium heat, combine shallots, ginger, lemon juice, and white wine.

The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

For the egg rolls: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Spray a rimmed baking sheet generously with cooking spray.                          In a large bowl, combine the cheese, corn, beans, spinach, chiles, scallions, cumin, chili powder, cayenne and salt. Stir together, making sure to break up the clumps of spinach.                          Have a small bowl of water ready for moistening your fingers.                          Lay one egg roll wrapper out on a work surface and moisten the edges with your finger. Scoop 1/4 cup of the filling into the center of the wrapper; mound into a 1-inch wide log arranged diagonally across the wrapper, with about an inch of space to the corners. Fold the corners over the filling, gently pressing down on either side to secure the fold. Then, starting at one of the unfolded corners, gently but firmly roll up the egg roll. Place on the prepared baking sheet and repeat until all of the filling has been used.                          Brush the tops and sides of the egg rolls generously with beaten egg. Bake until golden brown all over, 15 to 20 minutes.                          For the salsa: Meanwhile, pulse the tomatoes, garlic and jalapeno in a food processor until the tomatoes are almost smooth. Add the scallions, cilantro, lime juice and salt; pulse just to combine.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 280 degrees F. and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
