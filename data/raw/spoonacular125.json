Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes.

Add the ground chicken and mix until *just* combined. Do not overwork the meat. Roll into desired size balls. Mine were about 1  tablespoons each.Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs to the skillet but do not overcrowd the pan. Cook for 4-5 minutes flipping as needed to brown all sides. Remember you want to just brown the outside, not cook all the way through. Remove meatballs to a plate.Tomato Sauce:To the remaining oil, add the minced garlic and continuously stir to cook for 30 seconds. Add the onions and let them sweat, about 2 minutes. Add the crushed tomato, red pepper flakes, water, pesto, and fennel seeds along with  teaspoon salt. Allow the sauce to come to a simmer, add the meatballs back in, cover with sauce. Cover the skillet with a lid and reduce heat to low. Allow sauce to simmer for 10-12 minutes or until the meatballs cook all the way through.Polenta:While the meatballs are braising in the sauce, heat the cooking liquids in a large pot until boiling. Reduce the heat to medium low, continuously whisk as you add in the polenta. Cover and let cook on low for 20-25 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. When the polenta is done, turn the heat off, stir in the parmesan and butter. Keep in mind the polenta will continue to thicken as it sits, you may need additional broth/milk to thin it back to your desired consistency. Serve topped with chicken parmesan meatballs. Top with fresh basil, parsley, and parmesan cheese if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Meatballs:In a medium mixing bowl, mix together all ingredients except the ground chicken until it resembles a coarse breading.","ingredients":[{"id":5332,"name":"ground chicken","image":"meat-ground.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"mixing-bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the ground chicken and mix until *just* combined.

Generously mist three 8-inch diameter by 2-inch high cake pans with non-stick spray, and line with circles cut from parchment paper.   Place the sugar, flours, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl, and whisk to combine.   Cut the butter into smaller pieces and add it to the dry ingredients.   Mix on low speed until the mixture resembles damp sand (30 seconds to a minute).   Add the eggs, one at a time, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl with a silicone spatula after each addition.   When all of the eggs are fully incorporated, add the Greek yogurt (or sour cream) and vanilla, and beat on medium speed for about 60 to 90 seconds, to aerate the batter and strengthen the cake's structure.   Divide the batter evenly between the three prepared pans, and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the thickest part of the cake comes out clean or with one or two moist crumbs.   Cool completely, then soak with cocoa simple syrup (optional), and fill and frost.     To make the cocoa simple syrup (optional):   Place the sugar and cocoa powder in a small pot and whisk to combine.   Stir in the water and place over medium heat.   Cook, stirring occasionally, until all the sugar has dissolved.   Place one cake layer on a serving platter. Use a pastry brush to soak the cake with the simple syrup before topping with filling.

Mix the ground chicken, green onions, celery, garlic, hot sauce, blue cheese, dressing mix, salt, cayenne pepper and egg in a large bowl.  Add the breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup at a time until the mixture will hold together well.Roll the mixture into 1-inch balls and place in the prepared baking pan.  Refrigerate for 30 minutes.While the meatballs chill, heat the hot sauce, butter, grapeseed oil, brown sugar, vinegar and salt in a small sauce pot over low heat and whisk to combine.  Whisk occasionally until bubbles form around the edges.  Allow the sauce to bubble for about 5 minutes and then remove from the heat.  The sauce should thicken slightly.  After chilling, remove the meatballs from the refrigerator.  Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat.  Add about 1/4 – 1/2 inch of grapeseed oil.

When cool enough to handle, rub off the skins (running under cold water helps). Cut 2 of the halves into large dice so you have 32 pieces (1 for the top of each biscuit); set aside. Finely chop the rest of the peppers, and transfer to a medium bowl.                          Switch the oven from broil to bake, and preheat to 400 degrees F. Remove the foil from the baking sheet, and line it with parchment. Beat the egg well in a small bowl.                          Add the cream cheese, mozzarella and half the egg to the bowl with the chopped peppers, add 1/4 teaspoon salt and mix to combine.                          Separate the biscuit rounds, and cut each into quarters. Make a deep indentation in the center of each quarter, and fill with a heaping teaspoon of the pepper-cheese mixture (it will mound above the biscuit a fair amount). Brush any exposed biscuit with the remaining beaten egg. Bake until the biscuits are puffed and golden around the top, 10 to 12 minutes. Garnish each with a piece of reserved jalapeno.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Position an oven rack 4 to 5 inches from the heating element, and preheat the broiler.

Line two 12-cup muffin pans with paper liners. Put the butter, cocoa powder and 3/4 cup water in a medium microwave-safe bowl, cover with plastic wrap and microwave until the butter melts, about 2 minutes. Whisk to combine, then whisk in the brown sugar.                          Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in the warm cocoa mixture. In another bowl, whisk the buttermilk, eggs and vanilla; stir into the batter until just combined but don't overmix.                          Divide the batter among the prepared cups, filling each about three-quarters of the way. Bake until the cupcakes spring back when touched, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool in the pans 10 minutes, then transfer to racks to cool completely.                          Make the topping: Beat the confectioners' sugar, corn syrup, shortening and peppermint extract with a mixer until a tight paste forms. Gather into a ball, place between two sheets of parchment paper and roll out to 1/4 inch thick (microwave 15 seconds to soften, if necessary). Use a 21/2-inch round cutter or juice glass to cut into disks; reroll the scraps. Place a peppermint disk on top of each cupcake.                          Make the glaze: Put the chocolate, corn syrup, butter and 1/4 cup water in a microwave-safe bowl, cover with plastic wrap and microwave on 50 percent power until the chocolate melts, about 2 minutes. Whisk to combine, then cool slightly. Spread the glaze over the peppermint topping, leaving some peppermint exposed. Refrigerate until set, at least 20 minutes. Serve cold.

In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment cream together butter and sugar until blended. Mix in egg then blend in sour cream, vanilla extract and almond extract. With mixer set on low speed slowly add in flour mixture and mix until combined.Cover bowl and chill until firm enough to roll, about 2 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees during last 10 minutes of chilling.Line two baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper. Remove half of the dough from refrigerator. Shape dough into 9 (1 1/4-inch, 20g) balls, 9 (1-inch, 14g) balls and 9 (3/4-inch, 9g) balls (spray hands with non-stick cooking spray if needed if dough is slightly sticky). For each snowman, place 3 balls in decreasing sizes with edges just touching on prepared baking sheets spacing them about 3-inches apart. Flatten balls right between 1/2-inch and 1/4-inch. Bake in preheated oven until nearly set, about 10 - 12 minutes (they should not be doughy). Let cool on baking sheet about 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool (I like to transfer to an airtight container about halfway through cooling so they don't dry). Stick one pretzel stick in each side of cookies for arms. Repeat process with remaining dough. Once cool frost with vanilla frosting (I like to add a small amount of frosting to each round then spread outward with an offset spatula). For the frosting: in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment cream together butter, powdered sugar, half and half and vanilla until light and fluffy.Cut or tear a small piece of orange candy then roll and shape into a tiny carrot nose and add to cookies. Decorate with icing as desired. Add mini M&M's for buttons. Store cookies in an airtight container in a single layer.*To measure flour (don't fluff flour first) scoop measuring cup into container then level top with a butter knife. If you are in high humidity you made need to add a few extra tablespoons of flour so dough is manageable. **I transferred mine to piping bags with Wilton #3 tips to get a finer detail for the eyes then used a Wilton #46 tip for the scarves.

Add the salt, and stir to dissolve it completely. Set this aside.In a small saucepan, mix together water and corn syrup. Use a funnel or spoon to carefully add the sugar to the middle of the sauce pan, making sure NOT to touch the sides of the pot. (When sugar crystals touch the side of the pan it can cause the mixture to crystallize and it will become grainy.)Now place the mixture over medium high heat and stir gently until the sugar begins to dissolve, and the edges are just beginning to boil.Cover the pot with a tight fitting lid. Let the mixture boil until it is completely clear. (When you cover the pot it allows the steam to roll down the sides of the pan and dissolve the sugar crystals.)Remove the lid from the pot, continuing to boil the mixture until it reaches 290 degrees on a candy thermometer. Lower your heat to medium low,continuing to cook, swirl the pot occasionally until the mixture is lightly amber and reaches 360 degrees.Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the cream. The caramel will now bubble, hiss and release a lot of steam, do not panic! This is normal! Keep stirring, making certain to scrape the bottom and sides as you go along. Once the caramel stops bubbling and acting crazy, add your room temperature butter and vanilla, and stir it until it is smooth, thick and well combined.Set the caramel aside.Set aside 25 perfect pecan halves to go on top of your brownies. Chop the rest finely, or place in a ziploc and whack the heck out of them.Pre-heat your oven to 325 degrees.Take your pan, I used an 8 x 8 pan. Line it with parchment. I take two long strips, wet them slightly and place one in each direction with a little hanging over the sides. Keeps the brownies from sticking to the pan and makes it easy to lift them out when you want to cut them. You can spray the parchment with non stick spray if you like.Combine both chocolates and your butter in a microwave safe bowl. Gently heat till chocolate is melted. I tend to go in 15 second increments to make sure it is mixing well and does not burn. Stir in the cocoa powder and mix.Whisk in the flour and the baking powder.In a larger bowl beat your sugar, salt, vanilla, and eggs. Whisk in the chocolate and blend until combined, I almost find using a wooden spoon best about half way through so the mixture does not get stuck all over the whisk.Gently fold in flour with a rubber spatula, or wooden spoon until almost combined. DO NOT over mix! Add your pecan and stir lightly. Again, do not over mix.Pour half of your brownie mixture into your parchment lined pan and smooth it out.Warm up your caramel in the microwave for a few seconds. Dribble about a quarter of a cup of the warm caramel over top of the brownie batter. It can be messy, it does not have to be perfect.Add the remaining brownie batter on top, and smooth it out.Place in your preheated oven for about 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.Remove from the oven and sprinkle chocolate chips on top of the brownies. Cover with a plate or parchment paper to allow it to melt and spread out. Remove the cover and smooth out the melted chocolate chips.Allow brownies to cool for at least an hour and a half if you can, this part is tough.Warm up the remaining caramel until it pours easily.Takes about 30ish seconds in the microwave.Pour the caramel over top of the brownies.Place in the fridge for at least 4 hours, if you can. Again this is the hard part.Take brownies out of the fridge and use the edges of parchment to lift them out onto a cutting board.Cut into pieces, topping each with a pecan half.Serve with a big old Turtle loving smile!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small bowl measure out the cream.","ingredients":[{"id":1053,"name":"cream","image":"fluid-cream.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the salt, and stir to dissolve it completely.

I chose the bowl and hand method.Sift flour into a large bowl.Make a well and add the water, oil, and salt.Begin to mix by slowly adding the flour into the water around the well.Once mixing becomes too hard to do in the bowl, dump the mixture onto a floured surface and knead until combined.I like to knead it for a few minutes, lay a towel over it to let it rest, then return and repeat a few times until I have a nice smooth dough.Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest on the counter for a minimum of 20-30 minutes.Once your dough has rested- Cut 2 sections of dough (one top, one bottom) and roll them out to fit your ravioli mold.Roll your dough as thin and as evenly as you can without ripping it, making sure that it is even thickness all around. If you have a pasta maker, make sheets of dough with it. They should be the perfect size for the mold.Place the dough on the metal part of the ravioli mold that has been sprayed with non-stick spray (**see note at bottom if you do not have a mold). Fit the white piece on top and set it aside while you roll out another piece of dough for the top.Remove the white part of the mold.Using a tablespoon, fill each hole in your dough on the ravioli mold.
