and Pinot Noir. After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Duckhorn Napa Valley Merlot with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Microwave for 1 minute; stop and stir. Microwave for 1 minute; stop and stir (3 minutes total cooking time). From there, I’ve used two methods: 1. Transfer pretzels to prepared tray, including any coating mixture that was at the bottom of the bowl and did not adhere, and keep pretzels fairly mounded up and close together so when drizzled with chocolate, it stays on them and not the paper. In a small microwave-safe bowl, melt the chocolate, about 45 seconds on high power, stopping to stir and heating in 10-second bursts if necessary until it can be stirred smooth.  With a spoon, drizzle chocolate over the pretzels. Garnish with sprinkles. Either allow chocolate to set up at room temperature or place tray in the freezer for about 15 minutes to expedite. This method yields slightly prettier pretzels, and is what I did for the photos. 2. Do not transfer the pretzels to a tray or paper. Keep them in the mixing bowl and add the chocolate chips, and stir to combine. Heat for 30 to 45 seconds on high power in the microwave to soften and melt the chocolate chips (pretzels are already pretty warm so that’s all that is needed to melt the chips), and stir to coat. Add sprinkles and stir to coat. Either allow pretzels to cool and chocolate to set up at room temperature in the bowl or place bowl in the freezer for about 15 minutes to expedite. This method yields slightly better coated pretzels, the chocolate is better distributed, and based on taste, I prefer this method but they look dark and are not as pretty.

Pinot Noir are great choices for Catfish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Tiamo Pinot Grigio with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

This is just to make sure the ingredients are well mixed and even dispersed throughout.Cut in the butter with your fingertips or a pastry blender. You want to work it to the point where the butter is mostly worked in and the dough looks like a coarse floury meal.Gently stir in the beaten eggs, milk and vanilla extract with a fork until the mixture forms a soft dough.Turn dough out onto a floured surface and give it a little light kneading, until dough comes together in a nice ball. The dough will be a bit sticky. Thats okay.Divide this dough into four equal-sized pieces, gently form each into a small ball, cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.Filling:Add figs, pecans, raisins, dates and walnuts to a food processor. Grind until its a coarse paste.Scrape into a mixing bowl and add the Cointreau, honey, lemon zest, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Mix well with a spatula to combine.Refrigerate until ready to assemble the cookies, at least one hour.Assembling the Cookies:Preheat oven to 350 F.Remove the dough from the fridge one dough ball at a time - keep the others cold as you work with each one because they are much easier to work with cold.Scatter some flour on the surface where youre rolling out the dough. It will help mitigate the stickiness of the dough. With a rolling pin, roll each dough ball into a long thin shape - about 16 x 4 in diameter and about 1/4 thick.Add 1/2 cup of filling down the center of each strip. Use your fingers to work it into a long thin strip of filling. The diameter of the filling should be about an inch or so.Fold one long side over the other and pinch the seams shut on all sides. Turn roll seam-side down and press the dough gently to flatten the seams. This will allow the cookies to bake best and look most attractive once done.Using a floured knife, cut the cookies into 1 1/2\" pieces and arrange about an inch apart on a baking sheet lined with a Bakers Mat or parchment paper. For a standard sized baking sheet, you should be able to fit 18 cookies on the mat per batch.Repeat until done with all the cookies and filling. As you fill up a baking sheet, place it in the oven and bake for 18 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes then glaze and top with colored sprinkles.Finishing the Cookies:While the cookies are cooling, combine the powdered sugar, milk and vanilla in a small bowl. Use a fork to stir until smooth. Set aside until cookies are ready to be iced.Once cookies have cooled for 10 minutes and are ready to ice, use an icing spatula to smear the icing on the top of the cookies then sprinkle with colored nonpareils while icing is still wet. The icing will set rather quickly so only work in batches of 3-4 cookies at a time.Allow cookies to cool completely before storing in an air tight container. They will taste best the day they are made, but they will keep for one week in the fridge. Layer cookies in the container with wax paper or parchment paper for best results.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cookie Dough:In a large mixing bowl lightly stir together the flour, baking powder, sugar and kosher salt with a wire whisk.

Place a 10-inch cast iron or stainless steel skillet under the broiler. Add oil to a wide wok or Dutch oven and heat over high heat to 350°F, as registered on an instant-read or deep-fry thermometer.

Using your fingertips, make a dozen to 18 small holes in the stretched dough, leaving the outer 1-inch intact.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Carefully lower dough into hot oil, using a wire mesh spider or large metal spatula to keep it submerged. Fry until puffy and lightly crisped on bottom side, about 45 seconds. Carefully flip the dough with tongs and cook until second side is crisp, about 45 seconds longer.

Noir, Riesling, and Sparkling rosé. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. One wine you could try is Bernardus Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"In a saucepan, combine tomatillos, jalapenos and enough water to cover.

Fold the excess dough into the sides of the pan and press to create an edge that’s flush with the top of the pan and about 1/2 inch thick.8. Pour the filling into the crust. Scatter the streusel topping evenly over the filling. Bake until the topping is evenly cooked and it no longer looks wet in the center, 50 to 65 minutes.9. Let the tart cool on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before serving (or, once it has completely cooled, wrap it in plastic and refrigerate overnight; before serving, let it sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours).10.

This can be accomplished easily if you blanch the peaches first. This will loosen their skin and the task is not nearly as messy as it would be with a knife.Prepare an ice bath in a large bowl large enough for all the peaches. With a paring knife, lightly score an X onto the bottom of each peach. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Carefully drop the peaches into the water for 1 to 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, move the peaches into to an ice-water bath to stop the cooking. Once the peaches have cooled, the skin should peel off easily. Slice each peach in half, remove its pit and cut each half into appropriately sized wedges.Prepare the topping. Melt the butter and brown sugar. Pour this mixture, while still warm, onto the bottom of the lined cake pan. Arrange the peach slices in an attractive circular pattern all around the bottom of the pan. Set it aside while you prepare the batter.Pre-heat the oven to 350 degree F. Cream butter and sugar together until light and creamy. Beat in the egg one at a time until well combined.Add in vanilla and orange zest. Sift flour, baking powder and salt together. Slow down the mixer and slowly add in the flour alternately with the 2 tbsp of milk. Mix until combined.Spread the batter over the peaches and bake the cake for 50 minutes or until golden brown, and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes. If it has a particularly large hump in the center cut this off with a serrated knife. You will get a better presentation if the cake sits flat and solid. Set a serving plate over the top of the cake pan. Using kitchen mitts because the pan will still be quite warm, invert the caked quickly. Let it sit undisturbed until you are confident it has removed itself from the bottom of the pan.  Remove the pan and carefully peel away the parchment paper.

Add additional salt or lemon juice to taste, if desired.Serve fruit salad alongside the toasted chile powder. Guests can sprinkle the chile powder onto their individual salad serving to taste. Younger and spice-sensitive guests may prefer the salad without the spicy powder, and people like varying degrees of spiciness, which is why the chile powder is traditionally served on the side. You may have some chili powder left over, which you can use for future fruit salads, or to sprinkle on chicken or fish-- anywhere you need a salty, spicy kick!
