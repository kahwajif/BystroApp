Spray two 8-inch round cake pans with cooking spray, or butter and flour them.                          Warm the oil in the microwave until it is softened or even melted but not hot to the touch, up to 30 seconds, then pour it into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the yogurt, brown sugar, applesauce and vanilla, and mix until combined.                          Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl.                          With the mixer on low, slowly add 1/3 of the dry ingredients to the yogurt mixture, then 1/4 cup of the milk. Repeat with the rest of the dry ingredients and milk. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer, and fold in the chocolate chips. Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans.                          Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 22 to 26 minutes. (Cooking times vary depending on the quality of the ingredients and weather conditions.) Let the cakes cool in the pans for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.                          To assemble: Rinse the grapes, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and strawberries until they're shiny and clean.                          Place 1 cake layer on a cake stand, and top with about 3/4 cup whipped cream. Place a strawberry that's 1 to 1 1/2 inches high upside-down in the center of the cake. (This will help keep the cream from smooshing out when you add the next cake layer.) Spread some of the fruit around the edges of the cake. Because this is a naked cake, you will want to pay attention to how you place the fruit on the edge.                          Place the remaining cake layer on top. Starting with a bunch of grapes still attached to the vine, place the grapes on the cake, then start building up around them. Fill in with the raspberries, blackberries and blueberries, and place a few more grapes around to balance the color. Finally, place some strawberries around the edge and maybe even 1 on top.                          Drizzle the chocolate syrup over the cake, and chill until ready to serve. If using confectioners' sugar, sprinkle it over the top immediately before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

This will help the ham heat more evenly in the oven with less risk of the outside edges drying out.\n\nthe ham: Wrap the ham tightly in aluminum foil, place in a roasting pan, and heat in a 275°F oven for 2 to 2 1/2 hours (depending on the size of the ham, could be less or more time), until the internal temperature is 100°F. (It's already cooked, you're just heating it.)\n\nthe glaze: Place the jellied cranberry sauce in a small saucepan on low heat. Whisk in the orange juice and brown sugar until the brown sugar is dissolved. Add the strips of orange zest. Heat until bubbly and whisk until smooth. Then remove from heat, take out the orange strips, and stir in the mustard.\n\nthe ham: When the ham is ready, remove from oven. Open up the foil and paint the ham with half of the glaze. Keep the ham uncovered and return to the oven, bake at 425°F for 10 minutes.\n\nagain and broil: Remove from oven and baste with the remaining glaze.

attached), add milk and yeast, stir and let sit until yeast dissolves, about 1-2 minutes. Add flour, 1/3 cup sugar, salt, eggs and vanilla, mixing on low speed until combined then on medium-low speed for 2-3 minutes. Gradually add in softened butter, mixing until the butter is combined and the dough is soft, about 5 minutes. The dough will probably be sticky, so if needed add in a few teaspoons of flour to remove it from the bowl. Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4-6 hours. (Note that the original recipe calls for 6-15 hours of refrigeration. Mine was perfect after 4 hours, but if you need longer (like overnight), that is fine.)While the dough is refrigerating, make the pastry cream since it has to chill. In a small bowl, stir together flour, sugar and salt. In a large bowl, whisk together egg yolks. Slowly add the flour mixture to the eggs, whisking until smooth and pasty. Heat a saucepan over medium heat and add milk, allowing it to heat until bubbles form around the edges, but not boil. Remove the milk and slowly add it to the egg/flour mixture, whisking constantly until combined. Once smooth and mixed, add the entire mixture back to the saucepan, heating over medium heat and stirring constantly. Cook until it thickens and comes to a boil, about 2-3 minutes. Immediately remove from heat and strain through a fine mesh sieve, the whisk in vanilla and peanut butter. Place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap, pressing it until it touches the surface of the cream. Chill for at least 4 hours. Remove dough and place on a floured surface. Roll it out until it is about 1/2 inch thick, then use a standard size biscuit cutter and cut out as many rounds as you can. Place on a baking sheet in a warm place and let rise for 2-3 hours, until they've doubled in size.Heat a few inches of oil over medium-high heat in a large saucepan. Once the oil reaches 350 degrees F, add the doughnuts 2-3 at a time and fry until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side. Make sure you are using a thermometer - do not allow your oil to get too hot! The doughnuts need nearly 4-5 full minutes in the oil so the insides cook, and if it's too hot the dough will burn. After frying, transfer each doughnut to a paper towel to let the excess oil drain. Let them cool to the touch, the roll in the remaining sugar. Give the doughnuts another 30-45 minutes to cool completely. While this is happening, beat the cold heavy cream in your electric stand mixer or with a handheld mixer until stiff peaks form. Fold in the peanut butter pastry cream, taking a few good minutes to fold it in completely with a large spatula. Using a pastry bag or simply a ziplock bag (or even a spoon), poke a hole inside the side of the doughnut and fill it with a bit of the pastry cream. To make the chocolate drizzle, heat the heavy cream until warm then pour over the chopped chocolate. Stir continuously until melted and smooth, then cover or drizzle the doughnuts. These are best when eaten immediately!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In the bowl of your electric mixer (with the dough hook attached), add milk and yeast, stir and let sit until yeast dissolves, about 1-2 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"yeast-granules.jpg"},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","image":"milk.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404628,"name":"hand mixer","image":"hand-mixer.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Add flour, 1/3 cup sugar, salt, eggs and vanilla, mixing on low speed until combined then on medium-low speed for 2-3 minutes.

Carefully spoon out 2 cups of oat flour and transfer to a mixing bowl. Whisk in baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar, and set aside. Add nondairy milk and banana to the blender and whiz until well combined. Pour into oat flour mixture, add raisins and stir to combine. It should be rather soupy. Add a handful (about 1/3 cup) rolled oats and stir. If it's still runny, add more oats. I usually add about 1/2-cup total. The batter should be thick like oatmeal (ha ha!) but not dry. Set batter aside and preheat oven to 375F. Grease a muffin pan and spoon batter into the pan. The batter will thicken and get a little sticky/tacky as it sets. If it's so thick you can't stir it easily, thin it out with a little nondairy milk, but you shouldn't need to. It should be thick like oatmeal or heavy mashed potatoes. Spoon into 12 cups, top with cinnamon (and brown sugar if you like) and bake 10-15 minutes, or until firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted comes out clean.Note: If you have a rather ripe (very sweet) banana, you probably don't even need the sugar, especially if you're used to eating unsweetened oatmeal. Or you could add a few dates in with the nondairy milk and banana for a naturally sweet alternative. Nutritional InformationServing Size: 1Servings Per Batch:                                     12Amount Per ServingCalories                                     90Fat                                     1.30g                                      Carbohydrate                                     16.60gDietary Fiber2.20gSugars2.30gProtein3.20g","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Transfer rolled or instant oats to a blender and whiz for a few seconds until flour forms.

smaller mugs by spraying the inside with cooking spray; set aside. In a small microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter, about 1 minute on high power. Add the chocolate chips and stir with a fork or whisk until melted and mixture is smooth. If necessary, heat for about 10 seconds if your chips are resisting melting. Add the egg, yogurt and water (or buttermilk, and omit the water if using buttermilk), sugar, cocoa powder, brown sugar, vanilla, optional espresso granules, and whisk until smooth. Add the flour, baking powder, optional salt, and stir until just combined. Pour batter into prepared mug(s). Do not fill your mug over halfway full with batter because it will overflow in the microwave. Use two mugs rather than one if you're on the fence because mugcakes need ample room for expansion because they puff dramatically during cooking. For 1 large mug, cook on high power for about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes, or until firm yet springy to the touch. For 2 smaller mugs, cook separately for about 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 minutes, each. For my 1 large mugcake as shown, I cooked for 3 minutes. At the 1 1/2 minute mark, the cake puffed up over the top of the mug by about 1 inch, where it stayed and 'hoovered' above the mug for the duration of microwaving. Immediately upon powering off the microwave, the cake fell, by about 2 inches below the top edge of the mug. Your mugcake will deflate considerably while it cools. While it cools, make the glaze. For the Vanilla Glaze - In a small microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter, about 1 minute on high power. Slowly add the confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and stir with a fork or whisk until smooth and combined. If necessary to achieve desired glaze consistency, add a splash of cream or milk. Pour glaze over the cake(s). It's amazing how much glaze the cake will soak up so don't be alarmed if it looks like you have a lot. If you do have extra glaze, it will keep airtight for many weeks in the refrigerator. Mugcakes are best eaten fresh, but will keep airtight for up to 2 days at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the Mugcake - Prepare a large mug (at least 14 to 16 ounces) or two smaller mugs by spraying the inside with cooking spray; set aside.
