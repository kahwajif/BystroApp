Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes.

Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by

Top each burger with 2 slices of cheese during the last 30 seconds of cooking, until cheese is melted.                          Put the burgers on the buns, top with the ham, some of the onions and some of the mayonnaise sauce and potato chips.

Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. The Fonterutoli Chianti Classico with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 24 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":440954,"title":"Fonterutoli Chianti Classico","description":"Color: Deep purplish-red but bright and exceptionally concentrated.Bouquet: Extremely intense and complex with scents of cherries and raspberries accompanied by light toasty and spicy shadings.Flavor: The impact in the mouth is incisive but soft due to a substantial structure of tannins in which those that are soft and well rounded stand out. Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8073684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Ffonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998%2F12434"}]},"instructions":"First, prep the breading.

oven to 400 degrees.Liberally spray two 12 cup muffin pans with the cooking spray.In a medium bowl, mix the all purpose flour, cake four, baking soda, baking powder, and salt; set asideIn a large, clean mixing bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar with an electric hand mixer on medium-high speed to firm (but not dry) peaks, 2 to 3 minutes, set aside.In another large bowl, beat the egg yolks wit the mixer on medium-high speed until thick, ribbony, and lemon-yellow, about 6 minutes. Add the melted butter, sugar, and vanilla; mix on medium-low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Add one-third of the dry ingredients and mix on low speed. Add one-third of the buttermilk and mix to combine. Alternate adding the remaining dry ingredients and buttermilk, ending with the buttermilk and mixing until just combined.With a large rubber spatula, gently fold the whites into the batter, leaving some streaks. The batter may be prepared to this point up to 2 hours ahead; cover and refrigerate.Scoop about 1/2 cup of the batter into each muffin cup-you can fill the cups to the rims. Bake, rotating the pans after 10 minutes, until browned on top and puffed and a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out dry, 20 to 25 minutes total.While the muffins are baking, bring the maple syrup to a boil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Put the strawberries in amedium serving bowl. Pour the syrup over the berries and set aside in a warm spot.Pop the muffins out of the cups and arrange on a platter.
