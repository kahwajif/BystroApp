Optionally, add corn meal to the pan, shaking it around so cornmeal sticks to the sides and base of the pan, discard excess; set pan aside.  To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add 1 1/2 cups flour, yeast (not necessary to dissolve it first; just add it in dry), 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, salt, baking soda, milk, water and beat on low speed for 30 seconds. Then beat on medium-high speed for 3 minutes. (To warm the milk and water, I poured them into a glass measuring cup and heated in the microwave for 1 minute on high power. I could comfortably stick my finger in the liquid after 1 minute; it was warm but not hot. If you don't have a thermometer this method will likely work. If you can't stick your finger in it, it's too hot; you will kill the yeast over ~140F)  Add the remaining 1 cup flour and beat until just incorporated, about 30 seconds; do not overmix. Batter will be gooey and sticky. Sprinkle in raisins and turn dough out into prepared pan without kneading it, leveling it in the pan as much as possible with your hands or a spatula. Cover pan with plasticwrap or a dish towel and allow dough to rise in a warm place for 45 to 60 minutes, or until it has doubled in volume. In the last 15 minutes of rising, preheat oven to 375F and make the cinnamon-sugar mixture, for both sprinkling over the top of the bread and for the butter. For the Cinnamon-Sugar Topping & Cinnamon-Sugar Butter - Combine 1 tablespoon brown sugar, 1 tablespoon granulated sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a small bowl and stir to combine. Before baking the bread, sprinkle a scant 1 tablespoon over the top of the loaf. Combine the remainder of the cinnamon-sugar mixture with the butter, stirring with a whipping motion until incorporated and fluffy. Bake loaf for 28 to 32 minutes, or until golden and set; some say tapping on the loaf should produce a hollow sound. Immediately remove bread from loaf pan and place on a rack to cool completely before slicing and serving. Bread may be served untoasted but toasting it is highly recommended. Bread will keep for up to 4 days in an airtight container or in a ziptop food storage bag at room temperature. Extra butter will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 months.  Note that if bread has not sufficiently cooled before wrapping, the cinnamon-sugar crunchy topping will melt from the trapped residual heat, creating a cinnamon-sugar syrup. I wrapped the loaf before bed and while it was about 90% cooled, the next morning the crunchy topping had turned into a syrup, a happy accident.

Bread will keep for up to 4 days in an airtight container or in a ziptop food storage bag at room temperature. Extra butter will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 months.  Note that if bread has not sufficiently cooled before wrapping, the cinnamon-sugar crunchy topping will melt from the trapped residual heat, creating a cinnamon-sugar syrup. I wrapped the loaf before bed and while it was about 90% cooled, the next morning the crunchy topping had turned into a syrup, a happy accident.

Stir to combine and leave at room temperature until bubbles appear and the mixture it's doubled in volume. Add the sugar, yogurt, eggs and salt and start mixing. With the dough hook on, on medium speed, add the 2 1/2 cups of flour. When all the flour is added the dough should form a ball around the dough hook. Increase the mixer's speed to medium and add the butter, one tablespoon at a time, waiting until the butter is incorporated before adding more. At first the douh will look like it's falling apart, but don't panic, keep mixing slowly increasing the mixer's speed to max once all the butter it's added.Knead for 2-3 minutes at its highest speed. Turn the mixer off and with a steady spatula or a wooden spoon scrape the sides of the bowl and the hook.  Turn the mixer back on the highest speed and knead for 2-3 more minutes. Scrape the bowl and the hook again. Continue mixing until the dough starts to come clean from the sides of the bowl and makes a slapping sound. At this point the dough sound be soft and elastic. Place the dough into a buttered bowl, cover with platic wrap and let at room temperature for 2-3 hours until doubled in volume. Or you can place the dough bowl in the fridge for 12-14 hours until doubled in volume. Once the dough is well rested, sprinkle your work area and rolling pin with flour and roll out the dough into a 10X6\" rectangle. Brush with soft butter and sprinkle with brown sugar and ground cinnamon (how much or how little it's up to you). Roll the dough from the wide side into a log, pinching the ends. With a piece of thread or dental floss cut the log into 8 rolls, placing them into an 11X7\" baking pan lined with parchment paper. Cover the rolls with plastic wrap and place the baking pan in the fridge for 6-7 hours overnight. In the morning, take the baking pan out, leave it at room temperature for about 15 minutes or until the oven it' heated to 375F. Bake the cinnamon rolls for about 27 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven, let cool for 5 minutes and frost them. To make the frosting, combine all the ingredients in a bowl, adding milk to reach the desired consistency.

Bring water for pasta to a boil. Season chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat a large oven-safe skillet on medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Once hot, add chicken and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes each. While the chicken is cooking, add pistachios, basil, parsley, garlic and cheese to a food processor. Pulse and blend until the nuts are coarsely chopped, then with the processor on, stream in 1/3 cup of olive oil. Add a little more if necessary, depending on how \"spreadable\" you want your pesto to be. Finish by adding in salt and blending once more. Spread a thin layer of pesto on top of each chicken breast in the skillet, then place in the oven and bake for 15 minutes.While chicken is baking, boil pasta and prepare according to directions. Once finished, drain pasta and toss with remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, about 1/4 cup of pesto, the red pepper flakes and grated pecorino. You just want a very light coating of pesto on the noodles. Once chicken is done, remove and spread a little additional pesto on top.

Remove from heat and let sit for about 5 minutes, or until mixture is 110-120 degrees F.In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine two cups of the flour with the yeast, salt, and sugar. Add the warmed milk mixture and the eggs and mix until combined. With the mixer on medium speed, add the remaining flour 1/4 cup at a time until dough is thick but still slightly sticky to the touch. Continue to knead on medium speed until smooth and elastic, about 4-5 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.Gently punch down dough to release gases and let sit for about 5 minutes. On a very lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a circle about 1/2 inch thick. Use a 3 or 3 1/2-inch round cutter to cut dough into circles. Use a smaller cutter, about 1 inch, to cut out the doughnut holes.

Remove doughnuts with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Top doughnuts as desired. Combine the granulate sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl.
