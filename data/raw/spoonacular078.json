Pour vegetable oil into a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan until it is three inches deep (the amount of oil you use will depend on the size of your saucepan). Turn the heat to medium-high, and insert a candy/deep fry thermometer. Heat until the oil reaches 375°F.                                                                                                                            3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 While you're waiting for the oil to heat up, prepare your frying station and batter. Place 1/2 cup of flour in a bowl and set aside. Place the remaining  cup of flour in a small bowl and mix with the baking powder and salt; add the milk, vinegar, and oil, and whisking the wet ingredients into the dry until you have a relatively lump-free, smooth, thick batter.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Remove the frozen candy from the freezer. It's go time.                                                                                                                            5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Dredge each piece of candy in flour, covering it completely. Holding it gently, dip each piece of candy into the batter until it is fully covered. Wipe hands off with a clean paper towel between dips, because your hands will probably get a little messy.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Quickly place the battered candy into the heated oil, being careful not to drop it and cause oil to splash up. Keep a close eye on the candy, because it will fry up quickly. If it bobs to the surface before it has turned golden, gently push it back down with a slotted spoon.                                                                                                                             7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Once the candy has reached an appealing golden hue, remove from the hot oil with a slotted spoon and place on a plate covered with a paper towel to absorb excess grease. Repeat the battering and frying process with the remaining candy. While frying, be sure to monitor the temperature of the oil and adjust your heat up or down accordingly, as the candy will melt if it is too hot, and it will take too long to fry and become greasy if the heat is too low.                                                                                                                            8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Let cool slightly, but serve while still warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Begin by freezing your bars: remove your desired bars from their wrappers, and place them on a plate or cookie sheet.

Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and cook the bacon until crisp. Transfer the bacon to a plate topped with a paper towel to drain and set aside. Reserve the bacon drippings in the pan and cook the onion in the bacon drippings until tender, about 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally.Add the corn kernels, diced potatoes, carrot, celery and half of the chopped bacon to a 4 or 6 quart slow cooker. Add the cooked onions. Pour the AlmondBreeze over the soup ingredients and add the bay leaves, kosher salt and marjoram. Stir gently to mix.Cover and cook on high for 3 hours or on low for 6 hours, or until the potatoes are fork tender.In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with  cup of the broth then stir into the rest of the soup.

For the chicken: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and adjust a rack to the middle position.                          Place the chicken on a baking sheet lined with a wire rack, or in a roasting pan with a rack, and drizzle the chicken with olive oil. Generously sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Pack the cavity with the garlic, thyme and lemons. Place the chicken breast-side down on the rack.                          Roast the chicken for the first hour at 400 degrees F, and then turn up the heat to 450 degrees F and roast until the breast temperature registers 160 degrees F and the skin is a golden brown, for the last 30 to 45 minutes. Then set the chicken aside to rest and cool.

110-115ºF on an instant-read thermometer. Stir in sugar to dissolve. Sprinkle yeast on top, stir in, and let sit for 5-10 minutes, until foamy. Meanwhile, melt the butter in the microwave, and let it cool to 110-115ºF. Your goal is to have it at this temperature when your yeast mixture is ready. Transfer the yeast mixture to a large bowl and add the butter. Sprinkle 12 3/4 ounces (3 cups, spoon and level) bread flour on top. Add the salt. Mix everything together with a wooden spoon until a dough forms. It should be pretty wet/sticky. Gradually add a bit of the remaining flour** to the dough as needed and mix in until you can work the dough with your hands without it getting stuck everywhere. Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead, incorporating more of the remaining flour as necessary, for about 10 minutes.*** When the dough is ready, it should be elastic and tacky, but no so sticky that it gets stuck to the counter or your hands. Shape dough into a smooth ball and place in a greased bowl that is twice its size. Turn once to coat the top of the dough with the cooking spray, and then cover with plastic wrap and leave to rise in a warm spot until doubled in size (about 1 hour). Toss the shredded cheese with the minced jalapeño to evenly combine.Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Punch down the risen dough and divide into 9 equal portions (if you have a kitchen scale, use it to make each portion equal in weight). Working with one portion at a time and leaving the rest of the dough covered with plastic wrap, flatten the piece into a round (make sure the center is smooth) and place a scoop of the cheese mixture in the center. Again, if you have a scale, use it to weigh the cheese and jalapeño filling so that you can place an equal amount in each roll. Wrap the filling up inside the dough by lifting the edges of the dough and bringing them together in the center, pinching closed. (Picture tying up a knapsack.) Make sure all of the filling gets sealed in. Turn the roll over and round out the edges with your palms, gently pulling dough towards the bottom of the roll if needed to help smooth out the top.**** Place roll pinch-side down on one of the prepared baking sheets. Cover and repeat with remaining rolls, leaving ample space between each roll on the baking sheet. Once all are shaped, cover and leave to rise for 30-40 minutes, until very puffy, like this. Before starting the poaching step, preheat oven to 400ºF with oven racks set in the bottom and top-third positions.Combine water and baking soda in a large saucepan and bring to a simmer. One by one, gently dunk each roll into the simmering liquid, top-side up. Poach for about 20 seconds, and then carefully flip with a small strainer and poach for another 20 seconds. Lift up the roll with the strainer, let the excess water drain, and flip roll top-side up onto one of the prepared baking sheets. Repeat with remaining rolls, dividing between the two baking sheets, leaving a couple inches of space between each roll. The rolls will look wrinkled once they come out of the poaching liquid, but they'll smooth out once they bake. Whisk the egg white with the water for the glaze. Brush glaze all over the exposed areas of the rolls. Sprinkle the top of each roll with some sea salt or pretzel salt. Bake rolls for 18-20 minutes, flipping and rotating baking sheets halfway through the baking time. Tops should be golden when done, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the bottom center of one of the rolls should read about 210ºF. These are best served warm from the oven, but you can also allow them to cool completely on a wire rack and reheat before serving. Rolls can be wrapped in a light kitchen linen and reheated in the microwave, or you can stick the whole batch in a warm oven for a couple minutes to reheat. Any leftover rolls should be kept in a ziploc-type bag.*****","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a microwave safe measuring glass or bowl with at least a 2-cup capacity, microwave the water for 30-40 seconds, until it reads 110-115ºF on an instant-read thermometer.

Let set for 10 minutes to bloom.In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, salt and evaporated milk. Add to the yeast mixture and stir on low with the paddle attachment (or wooden spoon) until incorporated.  Stir in 3 cups of the flour then mix in the shortening on medium speed.  With the mixer on low, add in the rest of the flour.Change to the dough hook and knead the dough until smooth, adding more flour (up to 2-3 Tbs) if necessary.  Alternatively, you can knead the dough on a floured surface by hand until smooth.  Transfer the dough to a large bowl, lightly greased with nonstick spray.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise for at least 2 hours.**At this point (after the rise) you can either continue on or store the dough in the refrigerator overnight and complete the rest of the steps in the morning.**Heat at least 1 inch of oil to between 350 to 380 degrees F in a large cast iron skillet or Dutch oven.As the oil is heating up, roll the dough out to a large 1/4-inch thick rectangle on a lightly floured surface.  Cut into 2-inch squares (pizza cutter works great).  Once the oil reaches between 350 to 380 degrees F, fry 3 to 5 squares at a time until lightly golden, just a few seconds on each side.  Tip:  Once the dough pops to the top of the oil and puffs a little, flip them every 2-3 seconds to keep from browning too much on either side, and becoming hard to work with.  Make sure you keep the oil between 350 to 380 degrees by reheating it between batches if necessary.Transfer fried doughnuts to a plate lined with paper towels to drain the oil for a few seconds.  Place about 1 1/2 cups of the powdered sugar in a paper bag.  While still warm, toss three to five doughnuts at a time into the sugar filled paper bag.  Fold bag closed and shake to coat.  Remove doughnuts from the bag and place on serving platter.  Repeat with remaining dough and sugar.Serve immediately.

Add the melted butter and egg and pulse a few more times to combine.Press the gingersnap mixture evenly over the bottom of the spring-form pan, and up the sides approximately 2 inches. Bake for 10-12 minutes.Once out of the oven, cut a parchment paper strip 4 inches high, and a little over 2 feet long, to line the perimeter of the pan. Tuck the parchment paper strip carefully between the crust walls and the sides of the pan. Adjust the paper ring to fit snugly around the crust the secure with a paper clip. Press the crust back gently if it has slumped a little.Spread the entire can of dulce de leche over the bottom of the crust. Then place the crust in the freezer for 15 minutes to chill.Scoop the ice cream into the crust and press down using a piece of wax paper. Smooth the top with a spatula. Place back in the freezer to firm up--30-60 minutes.Then release the sides of the spring-form pan and remove the ring and parchment paper.

In a mixer add the melted butter and sugar and mix until the sugar and butter are well incorporated. Add the eggs and continue mixing until the mixture is light.

Using a pizza cutter, cut the dough into either 6 equal pizza slices or 8, depends how big your want your rolls. Drop a teaspoon of jam or Nutella at the top of each slice, you can spread it around or just leave it as one big dollop. Starting at the top roll out each piece and shape into a crescent. I love making these it's so much fun.Repeat with the remaining balls. Put the sweet rolls onto an ungreased baking sheet. Before you put them in the oven, brush them with egg wash so they will turn out nice and shiny.

In the realm of Pinot Noir, the 2014 Reserve brings a little more intensity of flavor while still remaining elegant from the native yeast fermentation.","price":"$31.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/468085-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":12,"score":0.7729729729729731,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fmontinore-reserve-pinot-noir-2014%2F320519"}]},"instructions":"Directions: 1.

saucepan or Dutch oven. Add just enough water to cover; sprinkle lightly with salt. Bring to a boil; cover and cook for 10-12 minutes or until tender. Remove squash with a slotted spoon; let stand until lukewarm.
