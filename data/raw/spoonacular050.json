Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti.

Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"To make the dressing - add the lemon juice, vinegar, honey, mustard, salt and pepper to a small bowl.

salt, and lemon zest in a medium bowl.  Add the eggs and egg yolk and whisk until smooth.  Slowly pour in the milk, whisking continuously until all of the ingredients have been incorporated.  Whisk in the melted clarified butter.Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and rest the batter in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes (or alternatively, overnight or up to 48 hours in advance of when you are preparing the dish).Prepare the Whipped Meyer Lemon Ricotta Topping (see below).Heat clarified butter in a small non-stick pan over medium heat.  Once butter begins to sizzle just slightly, add a

and cornstarch in a small saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking, until thick enough to coat a spoon, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter, a little at a time, until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, then stir in the lime zest and salt. Set in a larger bowl of ice and stir until the curd is completely cool. Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface; refrigerate until ready to use.                          Make the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a muffin pan with 12 cupcake liners. Pulse the wafer cookies in a food processor until finely ground. Melt 2 tablespoons butter; add to the processor and pulse until the mixture comes together. Press about 1 tablespoon crumbs into each muffin cup.                          Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a medium bowl; set aside. Combine the remaining 10 tablespoons butter and the granulated sugar in a large bowl and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy, 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to low; beat in the eggs, one at a time. Add the vanilla, lime zest and juice and beat until well combined. Add the flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Increase the speed to medium high and mix until combined.                          Divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups, filling each about three-quarters of the way. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. Remove to a rack; let cool completely.                          Make the frosting: Beat the butter in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy, 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and beat in the confectioners' sugar. Increase the speed to medium high; add the sour cream, lime juice and salt and beat until fluffy, 2 more minutes.                          Place the lime curd in a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch tip. Insert the tip into the center of each cupcake and squeeze to fill. Frost the cupcakes, then pipe more lime curd on top. Top with lime slices and zest.                          Cook's Note: Key limes are smaller and more tart than regular limes. If you can't find them, look for bottled Key lime juice and use regular lime zest.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Make the lime curd","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine the granulated sugar, egg and egg yolk, lime juice and cornstarch in a small saucepan.

Set the shrimp aside in cold water. In the large \"gumbo pot\" boil heads and hulls for 30 minutes to an hour. This will give you Creole gumbo. Strain shrimp heads and hulls from stock and set aside. Discard heads and hull immediately. Otherwise, the next day your kitchen will smell like Bayou St. John.\nClean the fresh crabs  If the crabs are fresh, you must take time to clean them. Discard the hard back shell and some of the so-called \"dead man,\" or yellow insides. Clean and separate crabs and set aside. (Note: If necessary, you can use meat from king, Dungeness, snow or stone crabs for your gumbo).\nBefore you fire up the stove again, cut up your celery, parsley, peppers, onions and garlic, especially if you're alone and there is no one to help you stir the pots. It takes time peeling the onions and garlic  Put the celery and parsley in a separate container from the other chopped ingredients and refrigerate until needed to keep them fresh.\nPlace the gumbo pot with the shrimp stock on the stove. Add cleaned crabs and bay leaves. Stir slowly. You don't want your shrimp stock messing up the floor. Add celery, parsley, and tomato paste to the gumbo brewing on the stove. Bring to a boil. Turn down heat, cover, and let simmer.\nHere comes the roux -- a thick and flavorful sauce that has become one of the most important staples of Louisiana cuisine. Pour oil or shortening into a separate heavy skillet (please do not use a thin omelet pan) over a medium-low heat. Slowly stir in flour to make the roux. Keep your eyes on the skillet. If the phone rings, let the answering machine pick it up. Cook roux until it has a dark mahogany color. Do not stop stirring until roux appears nutty or grainy. If black specks appear, the roux is burned. Throw it out and start from scratch. A good roux could take 30 to 45 minutes cooking time.\nNow you are ready to add the holy trinity of onions, garlic, and green peppers to the roux mixture. Stir ingredients in slowly because the flour is still sizzling. The moisture will begin to disappear. This is when Jean would add another quart or two of water to the gumbo pot. Add roux to the gumbo pot. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower heat and cover. The kitchen should smell good right now. Pour yourself another cold something-or-other. You're halfway there. Come back to look and stir in an hour or so.\nSeason to taste: add salt, pepper, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and any Creole seasoning you like. Don't overdo it right now. Let the roux work its magic absorbing all the wonderful ingredients. Gumbo is usually very spicy, but you can keep it mild. Remember, if you have decided to use andouille sausage it is also hot.\nFry sausages and okra with a little bit of the leftover grease. Sprinkle a little leftover flour if the okra is fresh. Add to gumbo pot. Add chopped peeled tomatoes, stirring until well blended. Add more water if necessary. The roux will keep it thick and tasty. Return to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and let simmer, uncovered, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours over low heat.\nSkim any excess fat. Add shrimp. Stir in slowly as you increase the heat one last time. It's time to stir in the fil powder. Cook another 20 to 30 minutes until the gumbo is thick. Taste and adjust seasonings one more time. Did I mention the rice? Seafood gumbo is served over Louisiana rice. Of course, you can substitute for your own favorite rice. Just plain old brown or white rice will do. Before serving, taste one more time and adjust seasoning. Turn off heat and remove seafood gumbo from the stove.\nTo cool down the pot before serving, place it in the sink with a few inches of ice-cold water. If needed, add additional salt and Tabasco sauce. If you can see through the gumbo to the bottom of the pot, work on your roux next time.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Fill a 14-16-quart pot with two quarts of water and bring to a boil.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Meanwhile, peel and devein the shrimp, keeping the heads and hulls.

It is aromatically complex with layers of blue and black fruit, Indian spices, coffee hints, and pepper. In the mouth the blue/black fruit flavors and eastern spice notes are layered with a \"sauvage\" sense of wildness. Texturally layered, its flavors vary in intensity and quality over your tongue and palate.

Meanwhile, in a skillet, cook sausages in oil until a thermometer reads 160. Remove sausages, reserving drippings. When cool enough to handle, cut sausages in half lengthwise, then into 1/4-in. pieces; set aside.

apples into quarters, without peeling or coring them. (Much of the pectin is in the cores and flavor in the peels). Cut out damaged parts.\n\nFirst Stage of Cooking\n\n2 Cook the apples: Put the quartered apples into large pot, add the vinegar and water, cover, bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, cook until apples are soft, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat.\n\nPurée apples and add the sugar and spices\n\n3 Purée the apples through a food mill or chinois: Ladle apple mixture (cooked apples and liquid) into a chinois sieve (or food mill) and using a pestle force pulp from the chinois into a large bowl below.\n\n4 Add sugar, spices, lemon zest, and juice: Measure resulting puree. Add 1/2 cup of sugar for each cup of apple pulp. Stir to dissolve sugar. Add a dash of salt, and the cinnamon, ground cloves, allspice, lemon rind and juice. Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary.\n\nSecond Stage of Cooking\n\n5 Cook the apple mixture, stirring often: Cook the apple sugar mixture uncovered in a large, wide, thick-bottomed pot on medium low heat, stirring often to prevent burning. Scrape the bottom of the pot while you stir to make sure a crust is not forming at the bottom.\n\nCook until thick and smooth (about 1 to 2 hours). A small bit spooned onto a chilled (in the freezer) plate will be thick, not runny.\n\nYou can also cook the purée on low heat, stirring only occasionally, but this will take much longer as stirring encourages evaporation. (Note the wider the pan the better, as there is more surface for evaporation.)\n\nAs an alternative to stovetop cooking you can cook the purée uncovered in a microwave, on medium heat setting to simmer, for around 30 minutes. If you do this, monitor the cooking every 5 or 10 minutes. Microwaves vary in their power.\n\nCanning\n\n6 Sterilize canning jars: There are several ways to sterilize your jars for canning.\n\nYou can run them through a short cycle on your dishwasher.\n\nYou can place them in a large pot (12 quart) of water on top of a steaming rack (so they don't touch the bottom of the pan), and bring the water to a boil for 10 minutes.\n\nOr you can rinse out the jars, dry them, and place them, without lids, in a 200°F oven for 10 minutes.\n\n7 Pour the apple butter into hot, sterilized jars and seal. If you plan to store the apple butter un-refrigerated, make sure to follow proper canning procedures.\n\nBefore applying the lids, sterilize the lids by placing them in a bowl and pouring boiling water over them. Wipe the rims of the jars clean before applying the lids.\n\nI use a hot water bath for 10 minutes to ensure a good seal.\n\nAs the jars cool, you should hear the lids \"popping\" as they seal the jars.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preparing the Fruit","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Cut the apples into quarters, without peeling or coring them.

Mix all your ingredients for the dough, and make sure the butter is well-distributed.Form into a ball, wrap loosely with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for about an hour.Make a bunch of little balls that are roughly the same size — I usually get 20-24 balls out of this dough recipe — roll them into 3-4 inch circles and lay them out on baking sheets lined with wax paper without overlapping them. Stick them back into the fridge (or freezer) until you're ready to use them.For the filling:Heat 2 tablespoons of butter on medium-high heat in a medium pot and add the potatoes, salt, pepper and smoked paprika. Toss to coat evenly.Fry for 6-7 minutes on one side (without stirring) so they crisp up.Add a cup of chicken stock, cover with a lid and reduce to a light simmer.Cook for about 15 minutes (stirring every 3-4 minutes), or until the liquid is gone.
