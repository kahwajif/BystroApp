Make a well in the center, pour in the yeast mixture and stir with a wooden spoon to make a shaggy dough. Turn out onto a generously floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes, dusting with more flour as needed. Form into a ball.

Cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour, 30 minutes.                          Make the filling and topping: Toss 1/2 cup mozzarella, the cheddar, pecorino, garlic salt, granulated garlic and dried parsley in a bowl. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Put an inverted baking sheet in the oven; preheat for 10 minutes. Line another inverted baking sheet with parchment paper and sprinkle with the cornmeal. Cut the dough in half; transfer 1 piece to the parchment-lined baking sheet and stretch into an 8-inch square (keep the other piece of dough covered).

Prepare the deep fryer by filling with oil to the manufacturer’s suggested fill level. (Alternately, a cast-iron or other wide heavy-duty pan can be used; fill with oil to a depth of 2 to 3 inches, but no more than halfway up the side of the pan.)

                   Combine the water, sugar and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast on top. Allow to sit for 5 minutes or until the mixture begins to foam. Add the flour and butter and, using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until well combined. Change to medium speed and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, approximately 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl and then oil it well with vegetable oil.

Make a U-shape with the rope, holding the ends of the rope, cross them over each other and press onto the bottom of the U in order to form the shape of a pretzel. Place onto the parchment-lined half sheet pan.                          Place the pretzels into the boiling water, 1 by 1, for 30 seconds. Remove them from the water using a large flat spatula. Return to the half sheet pan, brush the top of each pretzel with the beaten egg yolk and water mixture and sprinkle with the pretzel salt. Bake until dark golden brown in color, approximately 12 to 14 minutes.

Make the Cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease two 9-inch cake pans, then line the bottoms with rounds of parchment paper. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; set aside.2. Melt the semisweet and unsweetened chocolates together with the 6 tablespoons of water in a small bowl. Use either a double-boiler or microwave on 50% for 30 seconds to 1 minutes. Stir until smooth, then set aside to cool to room temperature.3. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter and 1 cup of the sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium and beat in the melted chocolate until combined, scraping the sides of the bowl as necessary. Beat in the egg yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition.4. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add half of the flour mixture, beating until just combined. Add the buttermilk and the vanilla extract, mixing until combined, and then add the remainder of the flour mixture.5. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites on medium-high speed until they hold soft peaks. Slowly add the  cup of sugar and beat until they form stiff, glossy peaks.6. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold one-third of the egg whites into the cake batter to lighten it, then fold in the remaining egg whites just until theres no trace of egg white visible.7. Divide the batter into the 2 prepared cake pans, smooth the tops, and bake for about 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool the cake layers completely (leave them in the pans). While the cakes are baking and cooling, make the filling, syrup and icing.8. Make the Filling: Stir together the heavy cream, sugar and egg yolks in a medium saucepan. Put the butter, salt, pecans and coconut in a large bowl and set aside. Heat the cream mixture and cook, stirring constantly (scraping the bottom of the pan as you stir) until the mixture begins to thicken and coats the back of a spoon (an instant-read thermometer will read 170 degrees F.). Pour the hot custard immediately into the pecan-coconut mixture and stir until the butter is melted. Cool completely to room temperature.9. Make the Rum Syrup: In a small saucepan, heat the water and sugar, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has melted. Remove from heat and stir in the dark rum. Set aside until ready to use.10. Make the Chocolate Icing: Place the chopped chocolate, corn syrup and butter in a medium bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it just begins to boil. Remove from heat and pour over the chocolate. Let stand one minute, then stir until smooth. Cool to room temperature.11. Once the filling and icing are both cooled to room temperature, refrigerate for 1 hour.12. Assemble the Cake: Remove the cake layers from the pans and cut both cake layers in half horizontally using a sharp serrated knife, so you have four cake layers. Set the first cake layer on a cake plate. Brush the top of the cake layer with the rum syrup. Spread  cup of the coconut filling over the cake layer, making sure to reach to the edges. Set another cake layer on top. Repeat, brushing the top of each cake layer with the rum syrup, then spreading  cup of the coconut filling over each layer, including the top. Ice the sides with the chocolate icing, then pipe a decorative border of chocolate icing around the top, encircling the coconut topping.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the Cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Season with salt and pepper. Fry a tiny bit of the mixture in a pan with a little olive or sunflower oil to see if the seasoning is good.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Divide the mixture into twelve portions and shape each one into a sausage. Place on a baking sheet or plate and set aside until you want to cook them. (Chilling them for a day in the fridge is fine, or you can freeze them.)                                                                                                                             3                                                                            To make the colcannon: Cook the potatoes, covered, in boiling salted water for 10 minutes. Then drain three-quarters of the water and continue to cook over low heat with the lid on for another 20 to 30 minutes until cooked. Test using a skewer or feel with your fingers; avoid stabbing the potatoes with a knife because this will make them break up. When cooked, drain all the remaining water, peel, and mash with 1/4 cup of the butter while hot. I usually hold the potato on a fork and peel with a knife if they are hot.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Meanwhile, cook the cabbage. Cut the cabbage into quarters, then cut out the core. Thinly slice the cabbage across the grain. Heat a saucepan, add the remaining 1/4 cup butter, water, and the sliced cabbage. Toss over medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes, until just cooked. Add to the potatoes, then add most of the hot milk and the parsley, keeping some of the milk back in case you do not need it all. Season to taste and beat until creamy and smooth, adding more milk if necessary. While the potatoes are cooking, make the applesauce and sausage.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            To make the applesauce: Put the apple in a small saucepan with the water. Cover and cook over a gentle heat (stir every now and then) until the apple has broken down to a mush. Add sugar to taste.                                                                                                                             6                                                                            To cook the sausages: Heat a frying pan on a low to medium heat, add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and gently fry the sausages for 12 to 15 minutes, until golden on all sides and cooked on the inside. Serve with the colcannon and applesauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"To make the sausages","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Mix together the pork, bread crumbs, egg, garlic, and parsley.

and Pinot Noir. Chardonnay and chenin blanc are great matches for grilled or seared scallops. If your scallops are being matched with bacon or other cured meats, try a lightly chilled pinot noir. The Talbott Sleepy Hollow Chardonnay () with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 35 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":436621,"title":"Talbott Sleepy Hollow Chardonnay ()","description":"We select fruit from the finest sections of the acclaimed Sleepy Hollow Vineyard for this Chardonnay. Sleepy Hollow consistently produces Chardonnay with intense tropical fruit character, which exhibits both richness and finesse. Sleepy Hollow Chardonnay is considered by many as one of the quality standards for California Chardonnay. Vineyard Manager and Winemaker Sam Balderas keeps yields low to increase concentration and minimizes the handling of the wine to preserve the fruit's natural essence. This wine is 100% barrel fermented in French Oak and aged on the yeast lees to impart a rich, toasty, complex character to the wine. \n\nTasting Notes for this Vintage\nConcentrated rich flavors of tropical fruit marry with mineral elements and French oak accents. A typically high level of acid produces a long, clean finish. Our signature Chardonnay, this wine can be cellared up to nine years and improves with age.
