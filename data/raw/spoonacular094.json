Pour 1/4 cup water into a blender jar, and then pile in the remaining ingredients. Puree, scraping the inside of the jar as needed, until it forms a smooth, bright green sauce.2. Store this minty-hot sauce in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 1 month.Make the red chile, garlic, shallot sauce3. Pour the boiling water over the chiles in a small bowl, and set aside until the chiles have softened and the water has turned light reddish-orange, 1 to 2 hours.4. Drain the chiles, reserving 1/4 cup of the liquid.5. Pour the reserved liquid into a blender jar, and then add the chiles and all the remaining ingredients. Puree, scraping the inside of the jar as needed, until it forms a smooth, orange-red, pulpy paste.6. Transfer this knock-your-socks-off-hot sauce to a tightly sealed container and refrigerate it for up to 5 days, or freeze it for up to 1 month.Make the tamarind-date sauce7. Pour 1 1/2 cups water into a small saucepan, add the tamarind, and whisk until it has dissolved and formed a tart, muddy brown liquid. Add the jiggery and dates, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has evaporated by almost half, about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the sauce to cool for about 5 minutes.8. Transfer the dark brown, thin sauce and cooked-but-chunky dates to a blender jar and puree, scraping the inside of the jar as needed, until it forms a pancake-batter-thick, milk-chocolate-colored, tart-sweet sauce.9. Transfer the sauce to a tightly sealed container (preferably glass, stainless steel, ceramic, or plastic because of the highly acidic tamarind) and store it in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 2 months.Make the yogurt sauce with black salt10. Whisk the yogurt, sugar, and black salt together in a small bowl. Transfer the sweet-tasting sauce (with an aroma similar to that of hard-boiled eggs, thanks to the black salt) to a tightly sealed container and store in the refrigerator for up to 10 days. (I do not recommend freezing it).Make the chaat masala11. Preheat a small skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the cumin seeds into the hot pan and toast, shaking the skillet every few seconds, until they start to crackle, turn reddish brown, and are highly fragrant, about 1 minute. Transfer the toasted cumin to a spice grinder or coffee grinder, and allow it to cool completely.12. Add the pomegranate seeds and peppercorns to the cumin, and grind until the texture resembles that of finely ground black pepper.13. Transfer the ground spices to a small bowl and stir in the remaining ingredients, the blend will be light brown in color. Store in a tightly sealed container, away from excess light, heat, and humidity, for up to 2 months.Make the shells14. Place the mashed potatoes and salt in a large bowl. Hold the bread slices under running water to drench them, and then squeeze out as much water as possible. You should end up with a rolled-up wad of moist but firm bread. Work the bread into the potato mixture by squeezing handfuls of potato and bread together to blend them and then kneading the mixture, creating a slightly sticky dough; the softer the bread, the more slices you will need to get the right consistency. (This technique of creating instant dough with moist bread slices works well as a binder to hold the patties together while pan-frying.) Rub the oil over the dough and allow it to rest, covered with plastic wrap or with a clean, moistened paper towel, for 15 to 20 minutes.Make the filling15. Heat the oil in a medium-size skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and stir-fry until it is light brown around the edges, 3 to 4 minutes.16. Add the sprouted peas, cilantro, spice blend, cayenne, and salt. Cook, stirring frequently, to warm up the sprouts and cook the spices, about 2 minutes. Set the filling aside.17. To assemble the potato shells, use your hands to shape the dough into a 12-inch-long log. Cut it, crosswise, into twelve 1-inch-thick pieces, and shape each piece into a ball. Working with one piece at a time, flatten it between the palms of your hands and shape it with your fingers into a dumpling-like wrapper roughly 3 inches in diameter and  inch thick. Spoon about 2 teaspoons of the filling in the center of the wrapper. Gather the edges and bring them together to the center, pinching the seam to seal it tightly, forming a mound that looks like a Hersheys Kiss. Gently flatten the top, making sure the filling stays completely covered. Press and shape it into a patty roughly 3 inches in diameter and  inch thick. Set it aside on a plate, and repeat with the remaining rounds.18. Line a large plate or a cookie sheet with several layers of paper towels.19. Heat about 3 tablespoons canola oil in a large nonstick skillet or a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Arrange 6 potato patties in a single layer in the skillet (do not crowd them), and cook until they are golden brown and crisp on the underside, about 5 minutes. Flip them over to cook the other side until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer the cooked patties to the paper-towel-lined plate, and repeat with the remaining patties, adding more oil as needed.20. Place 2 patties on each individual serving plate. Atop each patty, spoon 1 teaspoon of the Mint-Yogurt Sauce, followed by 1 teaspoon Red Chile Sauce, 1 tablespoon Tamarind-Date Sauce, and finally 1 tablespoon Yogurt Sauce. A little cilantro and a light dusting of the chaat masala complete the layered creation. Instruct everyone to fork right through to get the complete package in each addictive mouthful.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the mint yogurt sauce","ingredients":[{"id":1116,"name":"yogurt","image":"plain-yogurt.jpg"},{"id":2064,"name":"mint","image":"mint.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Pour 1/4 cup water into a blender jar, and then pile in the remaining ingredients.

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until soft and translucent, 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Set aside to cool.                          In a small bowl whisk together the egg and milk. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.                          In a large bowl combine the pork, potato, breadcrumbs, nutmeg, thyme and the cooled onion-garlic mixture. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Gently mix until combined. Cover and refrigerate while you roll out the puff pastry.                          Unfold the sheet of puff pastry on a floured work surface. With a rolling pin, roll into a 12-inch square about 1/8-inch thick. With a pizza cutter or knife, cut into four 3-by-12-inch strips.

Divide the pork filling into four equal portions. Form one of the portions into a long, tubular shape and place it on the puff pastry so it reaches from long end to long end. Brush the long side of the puff pastry furthest from you with some egg wash. Roll up the puff pasty away from you and around the pork filling to create a 12-inch-long log. Pinch the seams together and transfer, seam-side down, to the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pastry strips and filling. Freeze for 30 minutes to chill before baking.                          Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.                          Slice each log into six equal portions so that you have 24 rolls in total. Place the rolls on the baking sheet and brush with egg wash.

Butter and flour a 9-inch springform pan, set aside.In a very large mixing bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, ginger, nutmeg and allspice for 20 seconds, set aside.Peel apples, slice in half, core and stem, then laying apples on flat side, slice downward into pieces slightly less than 1/4-inch thick, then dice those pieces into smaller chunks (about 2 or 3 chunks depending on size of apples). Add apples to flour mixture and toss well to evenly coat, while working to separate any apples that may be stuck together.In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together milk, eggs and vanilla until well combined. Pour milk mixture over apple/flour mixture and using clean hands, toss just until combined (batter will be slightly lumpy but that's fine, just don't over-mix).Pour batter into prepared baking dish and spread into an even layer. Bake in preheated oven 45 - 50 minutes until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean. Cool about 5 minutes on a wire rack then remove ring from springform pan and allow cake to cool to desired temperature. Serve warm drizzled with warm custard sauce (or cool with cold custard sauce, however you prefer).For the custard sauce:Heat milk with a pinch of salt over medium heat, and bring just to a light boil (keep an eye on it and remove from burner if needed before letting it rapidly boil). Meanwhile, add egg yolks and sugar to a medium mixing bowl and whisk vigorously until pale and fluffy, about 2 - 3 minutes (alternately you can do this with an electric hand mixer on high speed for about 30 seconds if you don't want to mix that long by hand). Reduce burner to medium-low heat, then while whisking egg yolk mixture, slowly pour in 1/2 cup hot milk mixture. Then, while whisking milk in saucepan slowly pour egg yolk mixture into saucepan. Cook mixture, whisking constantly, until thickened and mixture coats the back of a wooden spoon, about 3 - 4 minutes (be careful not to over-heat it, if you cook it too long or don't whisk well the eggs will curdle). Immediately pour into a glass container, stir in vanilla and whisk about 20 seconds to cool slightly, then cover with plastic wrap pressing against surface to prevent a skin from forming.

Slice the apples with a mandoline to get them super thin, like paper. Or if that's not possible, as close to paper as possible. :)Sauce: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan. Add the brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and vanilla. Keep over medium heat and cook for about 3 minutes until smooth and thickened slightly. Pour the caramel into the greased cake pan and top with the apple slices.

The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.\nThis wine has a broad range of food pairings, whether alone with some well chosen cheeses, richer fish preparations or a good old steak on the barbeque.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438099-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":8,"score":0.82,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fdutton-goldfield-dutton-ranch-pinot-noir-2014%2F154141"}]},"instructions":"In a medium, non-stick skillet, sauté onion slices with 2 Tbsp water over medium-high heat until they begin to soften slightly, 2-3 min.Add peppers, jalapeno, chili powder, paprika, salt, cumin, and cayenne.

dry ingredients.Whisk the butter and heavy cream together. Add to the dry ingredients and toss again to evenly distribute. The butter will act as a glue, adhering to the dry ingredients and turning the mixture into a bunch of small clusters. The mixture should hold its shape if squeezed tightly in the palm of your hand. If it is not moist enough to do so, melt an additional 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons butter and mix it in.Eat immediately, or deploy as directed in a recipe. The crust is easiest to mold just after mixing. Stored in an airtight container, graham crust will keep fresh for 1 week at room temperature for 1 month in the fridge or freezer.for the cheesecake filling:Combine the white chocolate and oil in a microwave-safe dish and gently melt the mixture on low for 30 to 60 seconds. Use a heatproof spatula to stir the chocolate and oil together, working until the mixtures is glossy and smooth.Combine the cream cheese and powdered sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and stir together on medium-low speed for 2 to 3 minutes to blend. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.On low speed, slowly stream in the white chocolate mixture. Mix for 1 to 2 minutes, until it is fully incorporated into the cream cheese. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.Add the peppermint extract, salt, and food coloring and paddle the mixture for 1 to 2 minutes, or just until it is smooth and leprechaun green. (You may need to scrape the bowl down once mid-mixing.) No point in making ahead - you don’t have any use for it otherwise and it will make it trickier to swirl in later.for the brownie pie filling:Dump 1 1/4 cups graham crust into a 10-inch pie tin and set the remaining 1/4 cup to the side. With your fingers and the palms of your hands, press the crust firmly into the pie tin, covering the bottom and sides of the pan completely. Wrapped in plastic, the crust can be refrigerated or frozen for up to 2 weeks.Combine the chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl and gently melt them together on low for 30 to 50 seconds. Use a heatproof spatula to stir them together, working until the mixture is glossy and smooth.Combine the eggs and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whip together on high for 3 to 4 minutes, until the mixture is fluffy and pale yellow and has reached the ribbon state. (Detach your whisk, unk it into the whipped eggs, and wave it back and forth like a pendulum: the mixture should form a thickened, silky ribbon that falls and then disappears into the batter.) If the mixture does not form ribbons, continue whipping on high as needed.Replace the whisk with the paddle attachment. Dump the chocolate mixture into the eggs and briefly mix together on low, then increase the speed to medium and paddle the mixture for 1 minute, or until it is brown and completely homogeneous. If there are any dark streaks of chocolate, paddle for a few seconds longer, or as needed. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.Add the flour, cocoa powder, and salt and paddle on low speed for 45 to 60 seconds. There should be no clumps of dry ingredients. If there are any lumps, mix for an additional 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.Stream in the heavy cream on low speed, mixing for 30 to 45 seconds, just until the batter has loosened up a little and the white streaks of cream are fully mixed in. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.Detach the paddle and remove the bowl from the mixer. Gently fold in the 45 g (1/4 cup) graham crust with a spatula. (These crumbs will add little bursts of flavor and texture into the pie filling.)for the mint glaze:Combine the white chocolate and oil in a microwave-safe dish and melt the chocolate on low for 20 to 30 seconds. Use a heatproof spatula to stir the oil and chocolate together, working until the mixture is glossy and smooth. Stir in the peppermint extract.  (If you are using food coloring, stir it in here too.)to assemble the pie:Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.Pour the mint cheesecake filling into the prepared pie shell. Pour the brownie batter on top of it. Use the tip of a knife to swirl the batter and mint filling, teasing up streaks of the mint filling so they show through the brownie batter.Sprinkle the mini chocolate chips into a small ring in the center of the pie, leaving the bulls eye center empty. Sprinkle the mini marshmallows into a ring around the ring of chocolate chips.Bake the pie for 25 minutes. It should puff slightly on the edges but still be jiggly in the center. The mini chocolate chips will look as if they are beginning to melt, and the mini marshmallows should be evenly tanned. Leave the pie in the oven for an additional 3 to 4 minutes if this is not the case.Cool the pie completely before finishing it. (You can speed up the cooling process by carefully transferring the pie to the fridge or freezer directly out of the oven if you’re in a hurry.Make sure your glaze is still warm to the touch. Dunk the tines of a fork into the warm glaze, then dangle the fork about 1 inch above the bull’s eye center of the pie.Transfer the pie to the fridge so the mint glaze firms up before serving - which will happen as soon as it’s cold, about 15 minutes. Wrapped in plastic, the pie will keep fresh in the fridge for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"for the graham crust:Toss the graham crumbs, milk powder, sugar, and salt with your hands in a medium bowl to evenly distribute your dry ingredients.","ingredients":[{"id":1090,"name":"powdered milk","image":"milk-powdered.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Whisk the butter and heavy cream together.","ingredients":[{"id":1053,"name":"heavy cream","image":"fluid-cream.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"}]}]},{"name":"Add to the dry ingredients and toss again to evenly distribute.

On a large, oiled, inverted baking sheet, spread and flatten the pizza dough with your hands into a 10 to 12-inch free-form circle, 1/8-inch thick. Do not make a lip. You may end up with a rectangle rather than a circle; the shape is unimportant, but do take care to maintain an even thickness.                          When the fire is hot (when you can hold your hand over the coals for 3 to 4 seconds at a distance of 5 inches), use your fingertips to lift the dough gently by the 2 corners closest to you, and drape in onto the grill. Catch the loose edge on the grill first and slide the remaining dough into place over the fire. Within a minute the dough will puff slightly, the underside will stiffen, and grill marks will appear.                          Using tongs, immediately flip the crust over, onto the coolest part of the grill. Quickly brush the grilled surface with olive oil. Scatter the garlic and cheeses over the dough, and spoon dollops of tomato over the cheese. Do not cover the entire surface of the pizza with tomatoes. Finally, drizzle the pizza with 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil.                          Slide the pizza back toward the hot coals, but not directly over them. Using tongs, rotate the pizza frequently so that different sections receive high heat; check the underside often to see that it is not burning. The pizza is done when the top is bubbly and the cheese melted, about 6 to 8 minutes. Serve at once, topped with the basil leaves and additional olive oil, if desired.                          Sprinkle the yeast over 1/2 cup warm (105 to 110 degrees F) water and allow it to dissolve and activate, about 5 minutes.                          Combine the flour and salt and mound it onto a cool work surface creating a high walled well in the center. Combine the yeast mixture with 1 1/2 cups of cool water and pour into the well. Slowly begin to mix the water and flour, a little at a time, moving your fingers in short, counter clockwise circles around the border of the water. When the dough is firm enough to hold it's shape, scrape the remaining flour over it and knead until the mass is smooth and shiny, approximately 7 minutes.                          Transfer the dough to a bowl that has been brushed with olive oil. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil to prevent a skin from forming, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place away from drafts until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours. Punch down the dough and knead once more. Let the dough rise again for about 40 minutes, punch down again and form dough into 4 balls.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Prepare a hot charcoal fire, setting the grill rack 3 to 4 inches above the coals.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404706,"name":"grill","image":"grill.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"On a large, oiled, inverted baking sheet, spread and flatten the pizza dough with your hands into a 10 to 12-inch free-form circle, 1/8-inch thick.
