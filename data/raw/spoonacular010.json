Combine all the brine ingredients, except the brisket, in a large non-reactive bowl. Add the brisket (you may have to cut it into 2 pieces) and rub the spice mix into the meat. Pour cold water over until the meat is covered. Weight the brisket down with a small plate so that it is completely submerged; cover and refrigerate. The meat can be brined overnight or as long as 10 days. The longer the brining the more pickled the meat.                          Heat the oven to 300 degrees F.                          Heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. Add the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, marjoram, and bay leaves and cook until starting to soften, about 10 minutes. Remove the meat from the brine and rinse it well. Set the meat on top of the vegetables and add water to just cover the meat. Bring to a boil skimming any foam that surfaces. Reduce the heat to a simmer, place the lid on the pot, and cook for 15 minutes. Add the cabbage pieces, cover, and put it into the oven; cook for 3 hours.                          Remove the meat, cover it with foil, and let it rest for 20 minutes. Cut the fat off the corned beef, slice the meat against the grain, and serve it in shallow bowls with the cabbage wedges, some cooking liquid, and the Herbed Root Vegetables.                          2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil                          2 tablespoons unsalted butter                          1 pound new potatoes, scrubbed                          1 pound baby carrots, trimmed and scrubbed                          1 pound baby turnips, trimmed and scrubbed                          1 pound baby parsnips, trimmed and scrubbed                          Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper                          1/2 pound unsalted butter, softened                          1/2 cup mixed chopped fresh herbs like thyme, mint, chives, parsley, or chervil                          Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper                          Put the olive oil and butter into a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the vegetables and toss to coat them well with the fat; season with salt and pepper. Add 1 cup water and bring to a boil.

my top picks for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Tramin Pinot Grigio with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Heat at medium-high. Once mixture comes to a simmer, turn heat down to medium and add flour all at once. Stir rapidly and consistently with a wooden spoon, until the dough pulls away from the sides and the bottom of the pan is clean with no dough sticking to it. The dough should be glossy and smooth. Turn off heat and continue to stir rapidly for 5 minutes, evaporating moisture fromthe dough. Immediately transfer the dough to an electric mixer with a paddle attachment. Add 1 teaspoon salt, Dijon mustard, chopped herbs and ground fennel seed. Mix on low for 1 minute. Add 3 large eggs, one at a time, beating between low and medium, waiting for each egg to be completely incorporated before adding the next one. When the dough is cohesive, place into a pastry bag with a 5/8-inch plain round tip. Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a simmer. Holding the pastry bag over the edge of the pot of water, squeeze bag and cut dough into 1-inch dumplings with a paring knife. Allow pieces to fall directly into the water. Work in batches of 15-20 pieces. When the gnocchi float to the surface, allow to poach for 2 more minutes. Then remove pieces with a slotted spoon or strainer to a well-oiled baking sheet. Taste one for desired tenderness before continuing. When all of the gnocchi are finished poaching, cool in refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Cover until ready to use.     For Roasted Pumpkin  Remove skin and seeds of a small baking type of pumpkin. Cut into 5-6-inch chunks, toss with olive oil and salt and pepper. Bake in 350 oven until just tender when pierced with a paring knife. Remove from oven and let cool. Cut cooled pumpkin into 3/4-inch cubes.  For Roasted Apple  Peel and quarter apple, removing the entire core. Put apple and apple juice in a non-reactive sauce pot. Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt and cover. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Remove the apples from the poaching liquid and cool in refrigerator. Cut the cooled apples into 3/4-inch cubes.  For Pumpkin Sauce  Steam or roast 2 cups of peeled, seeded pumpkin flesh until completely cooked and very soft. Transfer cooked pumpkin and caramelized onion to a blender and puree with salt, pepper, lemon juice and vegetable stock to taste. Add enough stock to create a thick sauce consistency.

After the dough has doubled, pour the apples into the dough and knead to combine.Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper and spray with nonstick spray, Set aside.Bring 3 quarts water and the baking soda to a boil in large sauce pot.In the meantime, dump the dough out onto a slightly floured work surface and divide into 8 equal pieces (or 16 pieces for mini pretzels.)Spray a work surface with nonstick spray. Roll out each piece of dough into a 24-inch rope (12-inch for minis.) The apples will pop out a little, but keep rolling and you will reincorporate them.Make a U-shape with the rope. Take the ends and cross them over each other twice, and press onto the bottom of the U to form the pretzel. Place onto the parchment-lined sheets.Put the pretzels into the boiling water, one at a time, for 30 seconds. Remove from the water using 1-2 large spatulas. Return to the cookie sheet and brush each pretzel with the beaten egg yolk and water mixture.Bake until dark golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes.Transfer to a cooling rack and cool for at least 15 minutes before drizzling with caramel and sprinkling with salt.For the Dulce e Leche Caramel Drizzle: Because Dulce de Leche doesn't \"set\" like frosting, it's best to drizzle the pretzels right before serving. Place them in an airtight container to keep fresh. When ready to serve, warm the dulce de leche until slightly thin. Then place in a zip bag. Cut a small hole in the corner of the bag and \"pipe\" the warm caramel over the soft pretzels.

cup water. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook for 10-15 minutes, until softened. Drain excess water and transfer to a bowl mixing bowl.You can cook the millet at the same time as the lentils, or use the same pan after the lentils are cooked. Pour the millet into a saucepan over medium heat, and toast for about 5 minutes, until lightly golden. Pour in 1 cup water and ¼ teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, until most of the liquid is absorbed. Remove from the heat and let sit for 10 minutes. All of the water should be absorbed at this point. Pour the millet into the bowl with the lentils.Heat ½ tablespoon olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds), then add the onions and ¼ teaspoon salt. Cook until the onions are starting to soften, then add the green pepper. Cook for 3-5 minutes, until the green pepper is softened as well.Pour the stir-fried vegetables into the bowl with the lentils and millet, and refrigerate until ingredients are completely cool (at least 30 minutes).Preheat oven to 350.Add all remaining ingredients except the flour and egg (flax or chicken egg) to the bowl with the chilled lentils, millet, and veggies. Stir until the spices are incorporated fully into the mixture, then taste and adjust seasoning to your liking. Mix in the flour, followed by the egg.Shape ½ cup of the mixture into a patty, packing tight with your hands so it sticks together well. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining patties (you should end up with 7).Bake for 10-12 minutes on each side. After they're done baking, let them sit on the baking sheet for a couple minutes before moving - this will allow them to set up more.You can eat them as-is, but I like to pan fry them to make the outside a little crispy and golden. To do so, just use ½ teaspoon olive oil for each side of each patty (so 1 teaspoon total for each patty). Fry over medium heat for about 3 minutes on each side.Serve on buns (gluten free, if desired), with your favorite toppings - I like avocado, chopped radicchio, hot sauce, and hummus (bean on bean on bean, I know).","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small saucepan, combine the lentils with 1 cup water.

Add the onions and carrots, season with salt and pepper, and cook until softened, another 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook another minute. Add the ground beef and cook until the beef is no longer pink, 6 to 7 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the wine and add the marinara sauce and cinnamon.

For the cottage cheese layer: In a blender or food processor, add the cottage cheese, egg, and Parmesan, and pulse until the cottage cheese curds are small (the mixture will resemble ricotta). Season with salt and pepper and set aside.                          To assemble: Spray a 9 by 13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.

Position oven racks in the top and bottom positions. Lightly oil two jellyroll pans. Divide eggplant slices between the two pans, laying them out in a single layer. Brush the tops with olive oil (about 3 tablespoons total) Sprinkle with  teaspoon of salt per tray, and season with some fresh ground pepper, to taste. Bake in the top and bottom shelves of the oven for 30 minutes, switching the position of the trays half way through. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.Caramelize the Carrots and Mushrooms While the eggplant is roasting, heat two tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet. Add the chopped carrots and mushrooms and cook, over medium heat, for 12-15 minutes, stirring frequently and pressing them down into the pan with the back of a spatula, until they're lightly browned. Remove from the heat and set aside.Make the Sauce While the vegetables are caramelizing, make the sauce. Pour  cup olive oil into a large saucepan or dutch oven. Add the chopped garlic and red pepper flakes. Turn up the heat and when the garlic starts to sizzle a bit, lower the heat to a simmer and simmer, stirring, for 30-40 seconds (don't let it brown) and then pour in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, water, and basil. Simmer sauce, partially covered, for 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir carrot-mushroom mixture and chopped broccoli into the sauce and set it aside.Assemble the Lasagna Preheat the oven to 375F. Lightly oil the bottom and sides of a medium-sized casserole dish. Spread  cup of sauce into the bottom of the casserole. Arrange half the roasted eggplant slices on top (the arrangement will depend on the size of your eggplant and your casserole dish - see the photo of how I did it) Add half the remaining sauce on top of the eggplant. Arrange half the mozzarella, ricotta and parmesan evenly over the sauce layer. Arrange the remaining eggplant slices on top. Add the rest of the sauce. Finish with the rest of the cheeses.Cover the casserole with a double layer of foil and bake in the middle of the oven for about 55 minutes, until the lasagna is heated through and the cheese is melted. If you like your cheese browned, remove the foil for the last 15 minutes of cooking time. Remove the casserole from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes. Slice into portions with a sharp knife, and serve with parmigiana cheese and fresh basil sprinkled on top.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the Eggplant Noodles: Preheat the oven to 400F.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 350 F.

Butter doughnut pans with room temperature butter, then sprinkle lightly with flour and shake upside down to remove excess flour. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking soda and salt, make a well in center of mixture and set aside. In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together buttermilk, vegetable oil, vanilla and eggs (mixture will appear to curdle a bit which is fine), then pour into well in flour. Using a wooden spoon, stir mixture just until combined, then fold in 2/3 cup finely chopped strawberries. Spoon 2 1/2 Tbsp batter evenly into each well of the doughnut pans. Bake in preheated oven 11 - 13 minutes until toothpick inserted into center of doughnut comes out clean. Allow to cool several minutes in doughnut pan then invert onto a wire cooling rack to cool completely. Once cool dip top halves of doughnuts into glaze and allow some of excess to run off, then return to wire rack, glazed side facing upward. Transfer doughnuts to freezer to allow glaze to set, about 5 minutes. For the Strawberry Glaze:Prepare glaze just before dipping cooled doughnuts. In a mixing bowl, combine 1/2 cup finely chopped strawberries and half of the powdered sugar. Stir until mixture starts to become moistened, then allow to rest 1 minute. Add in remaining powdered sugar and freeze dried strawberry powder and stir until well combine (at this point mixture should be have the consistency of a thick glaze, and have a dip-able consistency, if not allow to rest another minute or two until some of the liquids have been extracted from the strawberries then stir again. I would not recommend adding water to thin. Just allow it to rest if needed until the strawberries begin to break down). Use glaze immediately.*For the 1/2 cup finely chopped strawberries for the glaze, don't chop until just before adding to glaze mixture (so they don't break down and become too watery) and don't prepare glaze mixture until doughnuts have cooled completely and are ready to be glazed.**I would say this is optional, if you omit it you just wont get as much strawberry flavor.
