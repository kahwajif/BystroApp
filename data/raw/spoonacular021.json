salt. Pulse 5 times to combine. Add the cubed butter and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse sand, about 12 times pulses. Add the cream cheese, milk, and vanilla and pulse until the dough forms a smooth ball, about 15 pulses.Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 30 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and place them into a non-stick mini-muffin pan. Using a dough tamper, or your fingers, press each ball into a cup shape. Cover with plastic and chill for one hour.Heat the oven to 350 F. Once the dough has chilled remove the plastic and bake for 13 to 16 minutes, or until the cookies are firm when pressed. Cool for 5 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a wire rack to cool to room temperature.Now, prepare the frosting.In a medium pot over medium heat add the butter. Cook, stirring constantly, until the butter browns and smells nutty. Cool the butter completely to room temperature.Once the butter has cooled add it into the work bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a medium bowl with a hand mixer) along with 3 cups of the powdered sugar, espresso, milk, vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Mix on low speed until the mixture is smooth. Add more powdered sugar one tablespoon at a time until the mixture is medium stiffness - meaning it holds a peak when you remove the paddle.To assemble the cookies begin by melting the chocolate chips. Place them in a shallow microwave safe bowl. Heat the chips for 30 seconds then stir. If the chips are not melted (and at this point they will not be) return them to the microwave for 12 second intervals until they are melted and smooth.Dip the top edge of the cookie cups into the melted chocolate, letting any excess drip off, then directly into the crushed peppermint. Pipe, or spoon, the buttercream into the cups and top with colored sprinkles. Chill for 30 minutes to set the chocolate before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Begin by making the cookie cups.In the work bowl of a food processor combine the flour, cocoa powder, cornstarch, brown sugar, and salt.

great choices for Halibut. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Proverb Pinot Grigio Wine. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 13 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":431299,"title":"Proverb Pinot Grigio Wine","description":"Luminous pear and apple notes animated with aromas of lime and lemon.","price":"$12.75","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/431299-312x231.jpg","averageRating":1,"ratingCount":1,"score":0.75,"link":"https://www.amazon.com/2016-Proverb-Pinot-Grigio-750mL/dp/B074G3D221?tag=spoonacular-20"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                Place fillets on a greased baking sheet.

In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish.

Line a 9-inch square baking pan with aluminum foil so that the foil extends 2 inches beyond two opposite sides of the pan, like little handles. Lightly grease the foil with cooking spray.Place the flour, sugar and salt into a medium bowl and whisk together. Scatter the butter pieces over the mixture and mix the ingredients together using a pastry blender or two forks until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs and large clumps hold together. (You can us a food processor for this step.)Scrape the dough into prepared pan and pat it into an even layer. Using a fork, prick the dough at 1-inch intervals. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until golden brown around edges. Set pan on a wire rack and cool completely.Set a fine-mesh sieve or colander over a medium bowl and set aside. In a medium-sized heavy, non-reactive saucepan, whisk together the eggs, yolks, and sugar until well blended. Stir in the citrus juices, orange zest, salt and butter and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens, 7 to 8 minutes (do not let it boil or it will curdle). Immediately strain the mixture through the sieve, pressing it through with a rubber spatula.Transfer ¼ cup of the curd to a medium bowl, cover and refrigerate. Scrape the remaining warm curd onto the cooled shortbread crust and spread it into an even layer. Place the pan in the fridge for 30 minutes, or until the curd is cool.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.Whisk the sour cream, heavy cream, sugar and vanilla extract into the reserved 1/4 cup orange curd. Transfer ¼ cup of the topping to a small bowl and set aside. Scrape the remaining topping over the cooled orange curd layer and spread it evenly.Add a small amount of orange food coloring to the reserved ¼ cup topping, just enough to turn it a pale orange. Scrape this mixture into a small sealable plastic bag and seal the bag. Snip a tiny hole in one of the bottom corners of the bag. Pipe the colored topping in a free-form filigree pattern over the bars.Bake the bars for 10 minutes, just until the topping is set (inner filling will be very jiggly but that is ok – just make sure the topping is set).

Fold the top of the circle over the filling and pinch the ends together with your fingertips to seal the pierogi.

Line a baking sheet with a Silpat or parchment; set aside. Scones - In a large bowl, add 2 cups flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, optional salt, and whisk to combine. Add the butter, and with a pastry cutter or two forks, cut the butter in. You can use a food processor, but I find not having to wash it is a big time-saver. I smoosh the butter with forks and when it's the size of large marbles, I use my hands and knead it in. It will feel like semi-wet, cool sand. Some larger pea-sized butter clumps are okay; set bowl aside. In a small bowl, add the egg, 1/3 cup peanut butter, sour cream, vanilla, and whisk to combine until smooth. Pour wet mixture over dry, and fold until just combined with a soft-tipped spatula; don't overmix or scones will be tough. If dough seems very crumbly or isn't coming together, add sour cream, 1 tablespoon at a time, until moist enough to come together. Add the chocolate chips and fold to combine. Turn dough out onto a Silpat  or clean, lightly floured work surface and with lightly floured hands or a spatula, pat dough into an 8-inch round, approximately 2 inches high. With a large knife, slice round into 8 equal-sized wedges. Using a flat spatula or pie turner, transfer wedges to prepared baking sheet spaced at least 2-inches apart. Do not crowd because scones puff and spread while baking. Bake for about 12 to 15 minutes, or until scones are very lightly golden and cooked through. They set up more as they cool; it's critical not to overbake or scones will be dry. A toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean or with a few moist crumbs, but no batter. Because they're baking in quite a hot oven, watch them closely starting after about 11 minutes to ensure the bottoms aren't getting too browned. Allow scones to cool on baking tray for about 5 minutes before removing and transferring to a rack to finish cooling. While the scones cool, make the glaze. Glaze - In a medium, microwave-safe bowl, add 1/2 cup peanut butter and heat for 30 seconds to soften. Add the confections's sugar, 2 tablespoons cream, and whisk together until smooth. Depending on desired consistency, you may need to play with the cream and sugar ratios slightly. Evenly drizzle the glaze over the scones before serving or frost them like a frosted sugar cookie, which I prefer. If you drizzle the glaze, you'll likely have extra. It will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 1 month; reheat gently in micro before using again. Scones are best fresh, but will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 3 days. I'm comfortable storing glazed items at room temperature, but if you're not, glaze only the scones you plan to consume immediately; I don't recommend refrigerating scones because they'll dry out.
