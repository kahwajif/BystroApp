Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti.

Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Bring a large pot of water to a boil.                          Spread the sesame seeds in a medium skillet over medium heat, and toast until golden brown, shaking the pan occasionally, 4 to 5 minutes. Let cool, about 10 minutes.                          Meanwhile, add the corn to the boiling water, and cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the corn to a colander, reserving the boiling water for later use, and run the corn under cold water to cool. Cut the kernels from the cobs; set aside.                          Transfer the sesame seeds to a blender and grind for 15 seconds. Add the oil, and puree until smooth and emulsified, about 15 seconds. Add the lemon juice, soy sauce, sugar, chile-garlic sauce and ginger, and blend for another 15 seconds.                          Add the soba noodles to the boiling water, and cook until the noodles no longer have a hard, chalky bite but are still springy, 3 to 4 minutes. Strain the noodles in a colander, and run them under cold water to stop the cooking quickly.

Add the bananas, pecans and cinnamon, turning them gently until the liquid coats the bananas and pecans. Carefully pour the rum into the pan, let it heat slightly and then ignite. If you are using a gas stove, simply tilting the pan so that the rum is at the edge without spilling should ignite the rum. On an electric stove, you will need to use matches. Fireplace matches are best since they are long and reduce the chance of burning your hand. Once the flames have died, remove the pan from the heat.3. Place one scoop of ice cream in each dessert dish and arrange the banana slices and pecans around it. Drizzle the syrup over the banana slices and ice cream. Sprinkle with shredded coconut and garnish with mint. Serve immediately before the ice cream melts.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Toast the pecans in a shallow baking pan under the oven broiler, being very careful that they do not burn, and then remove them from the oven and set aside.","ingredients":[{"id":12142,"name":"pecans","image":"pecans.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404646,"name":"baking pan","image":"roasting-pan.jpg"},{"id":405914,"name":"broiler","image":"oven.jpg"},{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Melt the butter in a saute pan over medium-high heat, until it bubbles and stir in the orange juice, Curacao liqueur and brown sugar, stirring continuously until the sugar is completely dissolved and the mixture begins to caramelize (thicken and take on a golden-brown color).","ingredients":[{"id":9206,"name":"orange juice","image":"orange-juice.jpg"},{"id":19334,"name":"brown sugar","image":"dark-brown-sugar.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the bananas, pecans and cinnamon, turning them gently until the liquid coats the bananas and pecans.

To make the sponge, stir the yeast into the flour in a 4-quart mixing bowl. Add the water, whisking or stirring only until it forms a smooth, sticky batter (like pancake batter). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature for approximately 2 hours, or until the mixture becomes very foamy and bubbly. It should swell to nearly double in size and collapse when the bowl is tapped on the countertop.2. To make the dough, in the same mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer), add the additional yeast to the sponge and stir. Then add 3 cups of the flour and all of the salt and malt. Stir (or mix on low speed with the dough hook) until the ingredients form a ball, slowly working in the remaining ¾ cup flour to stiffen the dough.3. Transfer the dough to the counter and knead for at least 10 minutes (or for 6 minutes by machine). Add the Asiago cheese during the last minute or so of kneading, and knead until evenly distributed. The dough should be firm, stiffer than French bread dough, but still pliable and smooth. There should be no raw flour - all the ingredients should be hydrated. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77 to 81 degrees F. If the dough seems dry and rips, add a few drops of water and continue kneading. If the dough seems sticky or tacky, add more flour to achiever the stiffness required. The kneaded dough should feel satiny and pliable but not be tacky.4. Immediately divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Form the pieces into rolls.5. Cover the rolls with a damp towel and allow them to rest for approximately 20 minutes.6. Line 2 sheet pans with baking parchment and mist lightly with spray oil. Proceed with shaping the bagels: Push a hole through the center of the roll with your thumb and stretch out the hole to 2½ inches in diameter, making sure that the resulting ring has a fairly even thickness all the way around.7. Place each of the shaped pieces 2 inches apart on the pan. Mist the bagels very lightly with the spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let the pans sit at room temperature for 20 minutes.8. Check to see if the bagels are ready to be retarded in the refrigerator by using the \"float test\". Fill a small bowl with cool or room temperature water. The bagels are ready to be retarded when they float within 10 seconds of being dropped into the water. Take one bagel and test it. If it floats, immediately return the tester bagel to the pan, pat it dry, cover the pan, and place it in the refrigerator overnight (it can stay in the refrigerator for up to 2 days). If the bagel does not float, return it to the pan and continue to proof the dough at room temperature, checking back every 10 to 20 minutes or so until a tester floats. The time needed to accomplish the float will vary, depending on the ambient temperature and the stiffness of the dough.9. The following day (or when you are ready to bake the bagels), preheat the oven to 500 degrees F with the two racks set in the middle of the oven. Bring a large pot of water to a boil (the wider the better), and add the baking soda. Have a slotted spoon or skimmer nearby.10. Remove the bagels from the refrigerator and gently drop them into the water, boiling only as many as comfortably fit (they should float within 10 seconds). After 1 minute flip them over and boil another minute. While the bagels are boiling, sprinkle the same parchment-lined sheet pans with cornmeal or semolina flour. Sprinkle the bagels with the shredded Asiago as soon as they come out of the water.11. When all the bagels have been boiled and topped, place the pans on the two middle shelves in the oven. Bake for approximately 8 minutes, then rotate the pans, switching shelves and giving the pans a 180-degree rotation. (If you are only baking one pan at a time, keep it on the center shelf but still rotate 180 degrees.) After the rotation, lower the oven temperature to 450 degrees F and continue baking for about 8 minutes, or until the bagels turn golden brown.12. Remove the pans from the oven and let the bagels cool on a rack for 15 minutes or longer before serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the sponge, stir the yeast into the flour in a 4-quart mixing bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"yeast-granules.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","image":"mixing-bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the water, whisking or stirring only until it forms a smooth, sticky batter (like pancake batter).

Beat in extracts. Fold in dry ingredients. Divide batter among pans; smooth tops. Bake cakes until tester inserted into centers comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool cakes in pans on rack.                                                            For almond praline:                Line baking sheet with foil. Stir sugar and 1/4 cup water in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil without stirring until deep amber, swirling pan and brushing down sides with wet pastry brush occasionally. Mix in nuts. Pour onto foil; cool. Peel foil off praline. Chop praline coarsely. DO AHEAD Praline can be made 1 day ahead; store airtight at room temperature.                                                             For mascarpone frosting:                Beat all ingredients in large bowl just to soft peaks (do not overbeat or mixture will curdle).                                                                Run knife around pan sides to loosen cakes. Turn cakes out; peel off paper. Place 1 cake layer on platter. Spread half of ganache over; sprinkle with 1/4 cup praline. Top with second cake layer. Spread remaining ganache over; sprinkle with 1/4 cup praline. Top with third cake layer. Spread frosting over top  and sides of cake. DO AHEAD Cake can be made 1 day ahead; cover with cake dome and chill. Store remaining praline airtight at room temperature.                                                            For chocolate bark:                Line baking sheet with foil. Melt chocolate in small bowl set over saucepan of simmering water. Stir until smooth. Remove from over water. Drizzle all but 1 tablespoon chocolate over foil in thick (about 1-inch-wide) zigzag lines (chocolate will pool in spots). Sprinkle 3 tablespoons praline over chocolate; chill bark until firm, about 1 hour.                                                                Press praline around bottom 2 inches of cake; sprinkle more atop. Peel foil off bark; break into pieces. Press edges into frosting atop cake. Remelt 1 tablespoon chocolate over simmering water, stirring often. Using spoon, drizzle chocolate over cake. DO AHEAD Chill up to 4 hours. Serve cold or at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"For ganache filling","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Simmer cream and sugar in medium saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar.","ingredients":[{"id":1053,"name":"cream","image":"fluid-cream.jpg"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add chocolate; whisk until smooth.
