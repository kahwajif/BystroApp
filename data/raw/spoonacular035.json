Heat the sesame seeds in a small skillet over medium heat, shaking the pan occasionally for about 5 minutes. Remove the seeds when they darken and become fragrant.Add the water to a medium size pot. Bring to a low boil and then add the rice and sesame oil. Stir to combine and then place the lid on the pot and turn the heat down to the lowest setting possible. Allow the rice to cook ten minutes on low and then turn the heat off completely and let the rice sit on the stove (covered) for another 20 minutes (don't take any peeks inside!). After 20 minutes remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork and stir in 1-2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds.

When the skillet is hot, but not smoking (if it starts to smoke, turn heat down a bit and wait 5 minutes before adding the pork) add the pork in a single layer (you may need to do this in 2 batches if your skillet is smaller) and allow it to cook for 2-3 minutes, so it can get a nice caramelization on it. Then toss it around and cook another 2-3 minutes, or until the pork is browned an just getting crispy on the edges. Remove the pork from skillet and set aside.If needed add another tablespoon of sesame oil to the skillet and throw in the red peppers. Stir fry the peppers for 3-5 minutes, until they just begin to soften. Add the pork back to the skillet along with the ginger and stir fry 30 seconds. Add the sweet thai chile sauce, soy sauce, ground cloves, cinnamon and pepper. Allow the mixture to bubble and reduce, about 5 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and coats the pork nicely. When the sauce is to your liking add the bok choy and toss well, cooking for another minute.

Layer a piece of heavy duty foil over a large baking sheet Lay on one more sheet in the opposite direction, leaving about 8 of overhang on all sides.Place marmalade and butter in a small microwave safe bowl and heat for about 30 seconds, or until butter is melted. Whisk until smooth. Combine this mixture with all ingredients (except fish) in a bowl and stir until smooth. Rinse salmon in cold water and pat dry. Place skin side down on baking sheet. Pour marinade over fish.Starting from one end, gather the foil overhang together and roll them together to seal a tent-like pouch. Bake in oven for about 25 minutes. Fish should be opaque and flake easily with a fork. Test fish and return pan to oven for an additional 5-10 minutes if necessary. Serve salmon with sauce spooned over top.Grill instructions: Preheat gas grill to 325. Place foil pouch on upper rack if you have one, or on indirect heat on the main rack.

Bake for about 18-20 minutes or until coating is a dark golden brown and crunchy.3.While the caulifloweris cooking, make sauce on the stove. Add all sauce ingredients except the cornstarch + water. Bring to a simmer and stir until completely mixed. In a small bowl, completely dissolve cornstarch in water, then add to the mixture. Stir until sauce reaches a simmeragain and cook until sauce thickens (about 1-2 minutes).Pour sauce over cauliflower. Garnish with fresh chopped scallions if desired.Coating cauliflower tips:- Make sure that you thoroughly whisk your eggs. Unwhisked egg whites will be slippery and likely slide right off the cauliflower.- Make sure to fully coat the cauliflower in egg. Also, let any excess egg drip back into your egg bowl to avoid adding extra moisture to your panko bread crumbs. When moisture hits the panko, it tends to clump up and doesn't stick as well onto the cauliflower.

Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                Cook pasta according to package directions.

With the motor running, drop the garlic into a food processor to chop it. Add the basil, pine nuts, and salt and pulse until the basil and nuts are coarsely chopped, then process until finely chopped. With the motor running, slowly drizzle in the oil. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in the Parmigiano and pecorino. (The pesto can be stored in a tightly sealed jar, topped with a thin layer of extra-virgin olive oil, for several weeks in the refrigerator.)Make the basic tomato sauce2. In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and light golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the carrot and thyme and cook, stirring, until the carrot is softened, about 5 minutes.3. Add the tomatoes with their juices, breaking up the tomatoes with your hands, and bring to a boil, stirring often. Lower the heat and simmer until the sauce is as thick as hot cereal, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and remove from the heat. (Once cool, the sauce can be refrigerated, tightly covered, for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 6 months.)Make the eggplant4. Preheat a gas grill or prepare a fire in a charcoal grill.5. Trim the eggplants and cut each lengthwise into 1/3-inch-thick slices, discarding the first and last slices from each one; you should have about 18 slices. Place the slices on a baking sheet and brush the slices on both sides with 1/3 cup olive oil. Transfer the eggplant over the hottest part of the grill, in batches if necessary, and cook, turning once, until soft and golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Return the slices to the baking sheet as they are done.6. Season the eggplant slices on both sides with salt and pepper and arrange the slices on a work surface with a narrow end of each slice toward you. In a small bowl, mix the goat cheese, pesto, and nutmeg until smooth and well blended. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Place about 1 tablespoon on the narrow end of each slice of eggplant and roll up, not too tightly, like a jelly roll.7. Put the tomato sauce in a medium bowl and whisk in the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil. Season with salt. Spoon the sauce onto a rimmed platter or small serving plates. Arrange the eggplant rolls, seam side down, in the sauce and sprinkle with the marjoram leaves.8. You can serve the eggplant slices now or refrigerate them for at least 1 hour or up to overnight to allow the flavors to marry. If you chill the eggplant, remove it from the refrigerator 30 minutes before serving to come to room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the pesto","ingredients":[{"id":93698,"name":"pesto","image":"basil-pesto.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"With the motor running, drop the garlic into a food processor to chop it.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"food-processor.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the basil, pine nuts, and salt and pulse until the basil and nuts are coarsely chopped, then process until finely chopped.

Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir. Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. One wine you could try is Director's Merlot. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 21 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":428445,"title":"Director's Merlot","description":"Our 2014 Director's Merlot offers lushness and a round, full palate. Its fragrance demonstrates red and black fruit with hints of anise and spiced wood. Juicy upon entry, the wine broadens and becomes velvety on the palate with flavors of plum, loganberry and black cherry accentuated by subtle spice notes of espresso bean and toasted vanilla. Medium tannins support the body of this wine, offering sophistication in its finish. Pairs nicely with brisket, grilled pork chops and linguine with pesto.","price":"$21.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428445-312x231.jpg","averageRating":1,"ratingCount":1,"score":0.75,"link":"https://www.amazon.com/2014-Directors-Merlot-750-mL/dp/B073XVS4MB?tag=spoonacular-20"}]},"instructions":"Directions:                                     Rub salt and pepper evenly over short ribs.

The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.
