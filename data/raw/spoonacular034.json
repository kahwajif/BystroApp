Add the leeks and cook, stirring often, about 10 minutes, until the leeks wilt. Do not let them brown. Add the garlic and cook for 2 more minutes, until the garlic is transparent. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and set aside.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Preheat the broiler and set a rack at the highest level. Heat a 9 to 12-inch castiron pan over medium-high heat. Brush it with some of the remaining butter. Pour 1/3 cup of crepe batter into pan and tilt to spread it in an even, thin layer. Cook for about 3 minutes, until the top of the crepe looks dry and slightly bubbly. Using a small offset spatula, release the edges of the crepe from the pan and flip the crepe with your fingers.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Sprinkle half the leeks and half the cheese over the surface of the crepe, leaving a space in the middle for the egg.

Start by putting the chicken in a pot and covering it with water. Bring the water to a boil, and then reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 45 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pot. Set the chicken aside to cool briefly.                          Shred the chicken with 2 forks, reserving the bones. Return the bones to the pot and boil for 20 minutes. Remove the bones from the pot and discard.                          Add the shredded chicken, carrots, celery and onions to the pot. Then add the salt, pepper, thyme and turmeric. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, and then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in the noodles; no need to thaw them first!                          Finally, mix the flour with 1/2 cup water until smooth. Stir the flour mixture, the splash of half and half (if you're into that kind of thing) and the minced parsley into the pot. Simmer until the noodles are tender, about 15 minutes, tasting and adding more salt if needed at the end. The soup should be thick and stew-like and your kitchen should smell like home.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Start by putting the chicken in a pot and covering it with water.

Remove the dough from the fridge and carefully pour and spread the Ricotta Filling onto the dough not more than about an inch from the edges (leaving a border).    Place the pitted cherries all over the Filling.    Bake until the dough is puffed and golden brown and the Ricotta Filling is puffed and set in the center, about 30 to 45 minutes depending on the thickness of the dough and your oven. Keep an eye on it; mine was perfect at about 40 minutes when golden brown.    Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly.    Top with some of the Port/Cherry sauce and serve warm or at room temperature.    Combine all ingredients together and simmer until sauce is thickened and coats the back of a spoon; approximately 10-15 minutes.    Cool until thickened.

The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.
