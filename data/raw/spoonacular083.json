One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and milk until light and fluffy.Heat a small pat of butter in a large skillet over medium heat.

Sleepy Hollow consistently produces Chardonnay with intense tropical fruit character, which exhibits both richness and finesse.

Vineyard Manager and Winemaker Sam Balderas keeps yields low to increase concentration and minimizes the handling of the wine to preserve the fruit's natural essence. This wine is 100% barrel fermented in French Oak and aged on the yeast lees to impart a rich, toasty, complex character to the wine. \n\nTasting Notes for this Vintage\nConcentrated rich flavors of tropical fruit marry with mineral elements and French oak accents.

x 1-in. baking pans with parchment paper. Grease the paper and set aside. In a bowl, combine the walnuts, flour and cocoa; set aside.                                                                                           In a large bowl, beat egg yolks on high until light and fluffy. Gradually add 2/3 cup sugar, beating until mixture is thick and lemon-colored. Beat in vanilla. Add cocoa mixture; beat on medium for 1 minute.                                                                                            In another large bowl, beat the egg whites, salt and cream of tartar on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in remaining sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, on high until stiff glossy peaks form and sugar is dissolved. Gently fold into cocoa mixture.                                                                                           Spread batter into prepared pans. Bake at 350° for 18-20 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Cool cakes in pans for 5 minutes. Turn each onto a kitchen towel dusted with additional cocoa. Gently peel off parchment paper. Roll up each cake in a towel, starting with the short side. Cool completely on a wire rack.                                                                                           For filling, in a large bowl, beat cream until it begins to thicken. Gradually add confectioners' sugar and vanilla; beat until stiff peaks form. Unroll cakes and spread evenly with cream mixture to within 1/2 in of edges. Roll up each cake again.                                                                                           Place one cake roll seam side down on the serving plate. Use the second cake roll for the branches. To make branches, measure 3 in. from top right corner of the second cake roll; cut at an angle from that point to the bottom right corner. Measure 3 in. from the top left corner; cut at an angle from that point to the bottom left corner. Save end pieces for another use. Measure 3 in. from the top right and 3 in. from bottom right; cut between the marks. Place cut cake sections along sides of cake for branches.                                                                                           For frosting, in a large bowl beat the cocoa, butter and 2 tablespoons water until smooth. Stir in corn syrup and 3 cups confectioners' sugar. Add additional water if necessary to achieve spreading consistency; set aside 1/3 cup of frosting. Frost top and sides of cake with cocoa frosting.                                                                                            To the reserved frosting, stir in the remaining sugar. Place a #5 round pastry tip in a pastry or plastic bag; fill with frosting. Pipe lines over frosting to create a bark-like effect. For holly, flatten gumdrops between waxed paper. Cut into holly leaf shapes. Place clusters of holly leaves and red-hot candies together on frosted log.

or slightly stale challah bread. If your bread is fresh, you can take some of the moisture out by placing the slices on a baking sheet and putting them in a preheated 350 degree oven for 10 minutes, flipping the slices once halfway through cooking. This will dry the bread out a bit, which will help it soak up the moisture from the milk and egg mixture. If you don't have time for this step, no worries-- fresh bread will work too, it just won't soak up as much of the egg mixture.In a small saucepan, combine Kahlua Coconut Crme ingredients and whisk together until combined. Turn on the heat to medium and heat the mixture, stirring constantly, until it begins to boil around the edges. Stir constantly until the sauce has thickened to a cream-like consistency. Turn down the heat to low and reserve, stirring occasionally until ready to serve.In a blender, combine the non-dairy milk (or regular milk for dairy), eggs, flour, banana, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, salt and Kahlua. Blend for a few seconds till well mixed.Pour the liquid mixture into a shallow baking dish or pie plate.Soak your slices of challah in the liquid for about 60 seconds, turning once, till the bread is nicely saturated on both sides. This should be done in batches.Heat your skillet over medium and grease it with 2 tbsp vegan butter (or butter for dairy). Fry the toast in two batches of 6 slices each.Let the slices brown nicely on each side for 3-5 minutes. Keep the heat on medium (or a little lower) to make sure the toast cooks through but doesn't burn.When the first batch of toast is cooked, re-grease the pan with remaining 2 tbsp of vegan butter and fry the second batch.Plate the French toast and garnish with powdered sugar, using a mesh strainer to lightly and evenly powder the toast with sugar.

Classic elegance and structure in which the fruit, tannins, and spices form a tightly woven balance, with a lingering fi nish of chocolate and coffee.Pairs exquisitely with traditional Italian dishes such as a classic bisteca Fiorentina, pasta Bolognese, wild boar ragu, and eggplant Parmesan. It’s also wonderful with dishes such as grilled ribeye and roasted vegetables.","price":"$25.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442701-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":5,"score":0.7975,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fruffino-riserva-ducale-oro-chianti-classico-2011%2F166890"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                Place the lettuce on a large serving platter.
