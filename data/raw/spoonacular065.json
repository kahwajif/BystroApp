Add diced cold butter and cut in with a pastry cutter until the butter is worked in and the mixture is crumbly. Stir in the pudding mix.Place the creamer, egg, vanilla, and lemon extract in a measuring cup. Whisk to combine. Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the wet. Stir with a fork until just combined (there may still be some dry ingredients in the bottom of the bowl).Turn out the dough onto a cutting board. Knead the dough a few times until the mixture comes together and is smooth. Cut the dough in half. Form each half of the dough into a disk thats about 1-2 thick.

Chianti, Trebbiano, and Verdicchio.

Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8073684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Ffonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998%2F12434"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 350F and spray a square baking dish with an oil mister or cooking spray.Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring often, until just beginning to brown, about 7 minutes. Sprinkle the flour into the skillet and give it a good stir. Cook, continuing to stir often, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Grab a whisk and slowly pour the milk into the skillet, whisking it into the flour mixture. Once the milk is incorporated and the sauce is smooth, add the pumpkin to the skillet and whisk that in. Let the sauce cook on medium heat until it's thickened, about 7 minutes, continuing to whisk often.Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the parmesan cheese, 1/4 cup of the sage leaves and a pinch of nutmeg. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then fold in the penne. Transfer to the prepared baking dish and top with the shredded cheese. Cover the baking dish with foil and place it in the oven. Bake for 10 minutes covered, then uncover and cook for 10 minutes more. If you want a browned top, broil for about 5 minutes or until the cheese is golden brown.While the casserole is baking, make the crispy sage topping. Heat the remaining 2 teaspoons of olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining sage to the skillet and cook, stirring often, until crispy, about 3 minutes. Keep a close eye on the sage because it will go from crispy to burnt really quickly! When the sage is done, transfer it to a paper towel to soak up some of the excess oil.

Grease cookie sheets or line them with parchment paper.In a bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Cream together the sugar and shortening. Add the egg and vanilla and combine well. Add in the remaining ingredients, alternating between the flour mixture and milk, starting and ending with the flour mixture and making sure all of the ingredients are well incorporated. The dough will be soft. Divide the dough into four even pieces, wrap each in plastic wrap, and refrigerate until ready to use.To make the filling, either process the nuts through a food processor until finely chopped (just a smidge larger than all-out ground), or chop by hand. The smaller the pieces, the better. Combine the chopped nuts with the sugar and then add in the melted butter. Mix well, making sure there are no large clumps. Add the egg whites and again, mix well.On a well-floured surface, roll out a piece of dough into a rectangle measuring about 6 inches by 18 inches. Spread ¼ of the nut filling onto the dough, leaving a small border around the perimeter of the dough. Roll up as you would a jelly roll, with the short ends to the left and right of you, and seal the ends. Cut the roll into 1-inch pieces and place on the cookie sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until the tops are just slightly starting to turn brown. Cool completely. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough and remaining filling.Once the cookies are cooled, prepare the icing by mixing together the powdered sugar, vanilla, and enough milk to achieve the desired consistency. You'll want the icing to be thick enough to not be runny, but still easily spreadable. Ice the tops of the cookies and let set completely before storing in an airtight container.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350°.

Sprinkle the rest of the mixture around the edges of the pan and press it against the wall to form raised edges (I wrapped my fingers in saran wrap to be a little cleaner).  Bake for 10 minutes, or until fragrant and firm.  Let cool while you make the filling.In a small pot over medium heat, combine the key lime juice and erythritol.  Stir occasionally.  When it starts bubbling turn the heat down a notch (in between medium and medium-low).  Still stirring occasionally, wait for the mixture to turn a light amber color and thicken (it should look like syrup), about 30-50 minutes (it takes some time, just be patient!).

Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an

Heat oven to 160C/fan 140C/gas 3. Butter then line the sides and base of a deep 20cm round cake tin with greaseproof paper. Mix together the figs, raisins, cherries, nuts and lemon zest.\nCombine the flour with the baking powder, mixed spice and ground almonds. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl until creamy, about 2 mins. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Gently fold the flour mixture into the cake mixture in two goes, then fold in the fruits and nuts, followed by the apricots and brandy.\nSpoon the mixture into the tin, then smooth the top, making a slight dip in the middle. Bake for 30 mins, then lower the temperature to 150C/fan 130C/gas 2 and bake for another 1 hr 45 mins, laying a sheet of foil loosely over the top for the final 15 mins if it starts to brown too quickly. The cake is done when a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean. Leave the cake in the tin to cool, then remove the lining paper and wrap well in cling film and foil until ready to decorate (see below or turn the page for another idea).\nTo create the frosty forest cake: colour the marzipan pale green with a little of the food colouring. Cut off 250g, then make this a shade darker with more food colouring for the trees. To make the trees, roll out the darker green marzipan on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar. Make pointed triangular cardboard tree templates in 3 different sizes (roughly 7.5 x 4cm/6.5 x 3.5cm/5.5 x 3cm). Using these as guides, cut out the tree shapes (see tip, above right). Brush one side lightly with honey, then scatter over silver and coloured dragees, pressing them down lightly to stick. Lay the trees on baking parchment to firm up. This is best done a day or two ahead.\nWhen ready to decorate, sit the cake on a board or plate. On a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar, roll the paler green marzipan into a circle wide enough to cover the cake completely. Brush the cake all over with honey. Using a rolling pin, lift and lower the marzipan onto the cake. Smooth the surface of the marzipan with your palms, then trim off any excess from the bottom with a sharp knife.\nCut off two-thirds of the ready-to-roll icing, then roll out a strip about 8cm wide and long enough to go over the top and down the sides of the cake. Cut a wavy line down either side to resemble a path. Brush the marzipan with honey where you want the path to go, then lay the path on top. Trim to neaten the ends.\nTake two-thirds of the remaining icing, then roll out 2 long, narrow ropes the same length as the path and about 5mm wide. Dampen the path edges with water and lay the ropes in position. Cut off and roll small pieces from the rest of the icing (and any trimmings), then shape into small snow drifts for the trees to stand in. When the trees are firm, make an indent in the top of each snowdrift with the back of a knife and put each tree into position. Sit the trees on the cake, securing with a little honey underneath. If necessary, cut off some of the rope along the edge of the path to make a flatter surface for the trees. Finally, scatter edible glitter onto the marzipanned cake.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the cake, soak the apricots in the brandy while you get everything prepared.","ingredients":[{"id":10114037,"name":"brandy","image":"brandy.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat oven to 160C/fan 140C/gas","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":160,"unit":"Celsius"}}]},{"number":3,"step":"Butter then line the sides and base of a deep 20cm round cake tin with greaseproof paper.","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404747,"name":"cake form","image":"cake-pan.png"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Mix together the figs, raisins, cherries, nuts and lemon zest.","ingredients":[{"id":9156,"name":"lemon zest","image":"zest-lemon.jpg"},{"id":9070,"name":"cherries","image":"cherries.jpg"},{"id":9299,"name":"raisins","image":"raisins.jpg"},{"id":9089,"name":"figs","image":"figs-fresh.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Combine the flour with the baking powder, mixed spice and ground almonds.

vegetarian"],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"Get everything you need out and ready before beginning because you'll be busy whisking and read the recipe over, at least twice, in full. In a medium sauce pan combine the sugar, flour, optional pinch of salt, and pour the milk over it. Heat this together over medium heat until it begins to boil gently, whisking quite frequently so that pudding skin doesn't form on the bottom of the pan. Keeping the heat at medium is advised because higher heat will likely cause the milky mixture to scorch. It took a good 15 minutes of the pot appearing to do absolutely nothing for my pudding to finally begin to barely boil because I was compulsively whisking. After you see the mixture boil, whisk continually for the next 2 to 4 minutes, or until the pudding has thickened. A transition comes when the pudding gets thicker by the stroke. Use your judgment and when you think the pudding has thickened up sufficiently, take it off the heat. Whisk in the vanilla; set aside. In a glass measuring cup, whisk together 3 eggs (using the same whisk is fine). Add about 1/4 cup of the hot pudding mixture to the eggs, whisking the whole time to temper the eggs so they don't scramble. Slowly pour the contents of the measuring cup into the sauce pan, whisking the entire time so you don't scramble the eggs. Return the pan to the stove, and cook over medium heat for about 2 to 4 minutes, whisking the whole time. This cooks the eggs. You'll know when the pudding is done and you can take it off the heat. It will be thick, creamy, and will look like pudding. It thickens up as it cools so don't over-cook it or it can get a little too firm. Take it off the heat; set aside, whisking every few minutes so skin doesn't form. In an 8x8, 10x7, or similar sized pan (9x9 is too big) make one even flat layer of Nilla wafers, covering the entire base of the pan (about 24 wafers). Top with banana slices in an even flat layer, covering the wafers. Whisk pudding and pour half over the bananas, smoothing lightly with a spatula. Repeat the layers, making one flat layer of wafers, another layer of bananas, and top with remaining pudding, smoothing the top lightly with a spatula. Cover with plasticwrap and refrigerate the pudding for at least 4 hours, or overnight. Before serving, evenly sprinkle the chopped wafers over the pudding. Pudding will keep airtight in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. The banana slices don't turn brown, although the wafers do continue soften as time passes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Get everything you need out and ready before beginning because you'll be busy whisking and read the recipe over, at least twice, in full.

Return the pan to the stove, and cook over medium heat for about 2 to 4 minutes, whisking the whole time. This cooks the eggs. You'll know when the pudding is done and you can take it off the heat. It will be thick, creamy, and will look like pudding. It thickens up as it cools so don't over-cook it or it can get a little too firm. Take it off the heat; set aside, whisking every few minutes so skin doesn't form. In an 8x8, 10x7, or similar sized pan (9x9 is too big) make one even flat layer of Nilla wafers, covering the entire base of the pan (about 24 wafers).

Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is King Estate Signature Collection Pinot Gris.

Once it has rendered a few tablespoons of fat, increase the heat to medium and cook until the pork is a crisp golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cracklings to a small ovenproof dish; reserve.                          Add the butter, onions, savory or thyme, and bay leaves to the fat in the pot and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the onions have softened but not browned, about 8 minutes.                          Add the potatoes and stock. If the stock doesn't cover the potatoes, add a little water. Turn up the heat and bring to a boil. Cover the pot and boil the potatoes vigorously until they are soft on the outside but still firm in the center, about 10 minutes. If the stock hasn't thickened slightly, smash a few of the potato slices against the side of the pot and cook for 1 to 2 minutes longer.                          Reduce the heat to low and season assertively with salt and pepper (you want to almost over season at this point in order to avoid having to stir once the fish is added). Add the fish fillets and cook over a low heat until the fish is almost done, 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and allow the chowder to sit for 10 minutes (the fish will finish cooking during this time).                          Gently stir in the cream and taste for salt and pepper. If you are not serving the chowder within the hour, let it cool a bit, then refrigerate (only cover the chowder after it has chilled completely). Otherwise, let it sit for up to an hour at room temperature, allowing the flavors to meld.                          When ready to serve, reheat the chowder over a low heat; don't let it boil. Warm the cracklings in a low oven (220 degrees F) for a few minutes.                          Use a slotted spoon to mound the chunks of fish, the onions, and potatoes in the center of large soup plates or shallow bowls, ladle the creamy broth around and scatter the cracklings over top. Finish each serving with a sprinkling of chopped parsley and minced chives.                          Melt the butter in a heavy 7 to 8-quart stockpot over medium heat. Add the onions, celery, carrots, bay leaves, parsley, thyme, and peppercorns and cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until the vegetables become very soft without browning, about 8 minutes.                          Place the fish head on the vegetables and stack the fish frames evenly on top. Pour in the wine, cover the pot tightly and let the bones sweat until they have turned completely white, 10 to 15 minutes.                          Add enough very hot or boiling water (approximately 2 quarts) to just barely cover the bones. Give the mixture a gentle stir and allow the brew to come to a simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes, uncovered, carefully skimming off any white foam that comes to the surface (try to leave the herbs, spices and vegetables in the pot).                          Remove the pot from the stove, stir the stock again and allow it to steep undisturbed for 10 minutes. Ladle through a fine-mesh strainer and season lightly with salt. If you are not going to be using the stock within the hour, chill it as quickly as possible.                          Cover the stock after it is thoroughly chilled (it will have a light jellied consistency) and keep refrigerated for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 2 months.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat a 4 to 6 quart heavy pot over low heat and add the diced salt pork.
