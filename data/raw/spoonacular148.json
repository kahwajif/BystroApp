1/3 cup warm water (about 110 degrees F) into the bowl of a stand mixer. Gently whisk in the yeast, 1 tablespoon of the flour and 1 tablespoon of the sugar. Set aside until bubbly, 5 to 10 minutes.                          Meanwhile, heat the milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until bubbles start to form around the edges, about 6 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the butter, the remaining sugar and the salt. Set aside to cool, about 10 minutes.                          Fit the mixer with the paddle attachment, set on medium-low speed and pour the milk mixture into the yeast mixture. Add the 2 beaten eggs. Gradually mix in the remaining flour, and beat until a soft dough forms. Increase the speed to medium-high, and beat until the dough pulls away from the sides and forms a ball, about 5 minutes (the dough will be sticky).                          Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface, and knead, adding more flour as needed, until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Put the dough in a lightly buttered large bowl, cover and place in a warm spot to rise until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.                          Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Punch down the dough, transfer it to a lightly floured surface and cut it into 3 equal parts. Gently roll out each piece into a 16-inch-long rope. Transfer the ropes to the prepared baking sheet. Press the ropes together at one end, braid them, then gently tuck both ends under to form a long loaf. Cover, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.                          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the entire loaf with the remaining beaten egg. Scatter the almonds and nonpareils on top, concentrating them down the middle of the loaf (they will spread as the loaf bakes). Bake until the loaf is dark golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped, 50 to 60 minutes. Let cool about 30 minutes before slicing.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pour 1/3 cup warm water (about 110 degrees F) into the bowl of a stand mixer.

In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish.

Pour into two greased and floured 9-in. round baking pans. Bake at 350° for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.                                                                                           In a large bowl, beat butter until light and fluffy. Add the confectioners' sugar, orange juice and peel; beat until smooth. Spread glaze between layers and over the top and sides of cake.                                        Yield: 12 servings.

Add the butter pieces and coat with the flour mixture using a bench scraper or spatula. With a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour mixture, working quickly until mostly pea-sized pieces of butter remain (a few larger pieces are okay; be careful not to over blend.)                                                                                                                            19                                                                            Combine the water, cider vinegar, and ice in a large measuring cup or small bowl. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the ice water mixture, 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time, and mix until the dough comes together in a ball, with some dry bits remaining. Squeeze and pinch with your fingertips to bring all the dough together, sprinkling dry bits with more small drops of the ice water mixture, if necessary, to combine. Shape the dough into a flat disc, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight, to give the crust time to mellow.                                                                                                                             20                                                                            Tips for Prebaking: Have your crust rolled, crimped, and rested in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. When it's fully chilled, use a fork to prick all over the bottom and sides, 15 to 20 times. This step, called docking, helps eliminate the air bubbles that can form when the dough is exposed to heat and also prevents the crust from shrinking. Place the crust in the freezer.                                                                                                                             21                                                                            Position the oven racks in the bottom and center positions, place a rimmed baking sheet on the lowest rack, and preheat the oven to 425F. Have ready 1 egg white mixed with 1 teaspoon of water to brush the crust with during baking. This glaze acts to moistureproof the bottom and sides of the crust that will be exposed to the filling. It's not totally necessary, but does make for a better final product.                                                                                                                            22                                                                            When the crust is frozen solid (about 10 minutes), line it tightly with a piece or two of aluminum foil. Make sure the crimped edges are completely covered and there are no gaps between the foil and the crust.                                                                                                                             23                                                                            Pour pie weights or beans into the pan and spread them so they are concentrated more about the edge of the shell than in the center. Place the pan on the preheated baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes, until the crimped edges are set but not browned.                                                                                                                             24                                                                            Remove the pan and the baking sheet from the oven, lift out the foil and pie weights, and let the crust cool for a minute. Use a pastry brush to coat the bottom and sides with a thin layer of egg white glaze (1 egg white whisked with 1 teaspoon of water) to moistureproof the crust.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Whisk the eggs in a small bowl.

Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a spatula until all the ingredients are incorporated.Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool completely.FOR FROSTING: Open the can of coconut milk and scoop out the chilled fat from the top into a medium saucepan, while leaving the liquid at the bottom of the can. Discard remaining liquid (or save and use it for smoothies later!)Place chocolate chips in the saucepan with the coconut fat. Heat on low, stirring occasionally with spatula, until melted and well combined.Transfer mixture to medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap.

Bring it to a boil and cook until skewer goes through the potatoes smoothly. Drain water completely and use a masher to mash the potatoes over very low heat.At this point, take out the puffed pastry from the freezer. Place 1 sheet of pastry on baking sheet which has been lined with parchment paper. Put another pastry sheet on a different sheet of parchment paper. Defrost for 10 minutes at room temperature. If you use Pepperidge Farm brand puffed pastry, you need to prick the pastry sheets with fork.Now back on the stove. Keep the low heat and slowly add in heavy whipping cream and mix well. If you don’t have 1 lb. sweet potato, you probably don’t need to use all of heavy whipping cream.Add sugar and butter and keep mixing. Then turn off heat and add egg yolk and sesame seeds. Combine well and set aside.Preheat oven to 400F. By this time the puffed pastry is defrosted so cut the sheets in half with a scissor. Now you have 4 rectangular sheets.

Then flip and cook on the other side until just done, 1 to 2 minutes; the fillets should be golden brown and just cooked through. Transfer them to a platter and keep them warm in a 200F oven while you make the sauce.                                                                            2. Add the remaining oil and the butter to a saut pan and cook over high heat until the butter starts to foam. Add the shallot. Cook until it is golden and the butter is a pale hazelnut brown, about 1 minute. Add the orange juice and cook for 1 minute more. Add the lemon juice. When the butter mixture starts to foam again, remove the pan from heat. Season with more salt and pepper, if desired.                                                                            3. Put a piece of sole on each plate, drizzle with the brown butter, and serve immediately.                                    Tip:Invest in a fish spatula. Longer and wider than a regular spatula, it's the tool you'll need to prevent fish from breaking when you turn or lift it in the pan.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Season the fillets with the salt and pepper and dredge them in the flour.
