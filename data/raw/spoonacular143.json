are great choices for Beef Short Ribs. Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. You could try Sagebrush Annie's Ventura County Cabernet Sauvignon & Merlot Ventura County.

Add the vanilla and sour cream and beat at low speed until combined.Add the dry ingredients and beat at low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds, scraping down the bowl as needed. Dough needs to obtain the right consistency for rolling, so add additional flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until this is achieved (up to 1 cup more flour). Divide dough into two sections. Flatten into rectangles about 1 1/2 inches thick, then wrap with plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator overnight.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Heat a non-stick skillet over medium high heat. Once hot add one corn tortilla at a time and cook 10 - 15 seconds per side (until tortillas become more pliable), then immediately transfer to a plate and cover with a skillet lid (to seal in moisture. Be sure it's a lid that will basically seal on bottom, as in there shouldn't be any space between the plate and the lid. This should prevent tortillas from cracking). Repeat with remaining tortillas and set aside.In a large non-stick heat 1/2 Tbsp of the canola oil over medium-high heat. Once hot add onions and saute until soft and slightly golden, about 3 - 4 minutes, adding in garlic during last 30 seconds of sauteing.

Add in chili powder, paprika, cumin, lime juice and season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat and stir in shredded chicken, cilantro and monterey jack cheese (you can add in another 1 - 2 Tbsp if of the salsa verde if you think it needs it, you want it to be creamy but not too wet or it will keep the taquitos from getting perfectly crisp). Spread about a scant 1/4 cup (about 3 Tbsp) of the chicken mixture in a row, closer to one side of the tortilla (about 1-inch from edge), then snuggly roll tortilla to opposite side. Place on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Repeat process with remaining tortillas and chicken mixture, spacing tortillas at least 1-inch apart on baking sheet for even toasting. Brush tops and sides of rolled tortillas lightly with remaining 1 Tbsp canola oil. Bake in preheated oven until edges are golden brown and taquitos are crisp, about 18 - 20 minutes.

Puree all vegetables and garlic in a food processor or blender until finely chopped into a thick paste.\n\n\nOnce browned, remove the ribs to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm. Drain the fat from the pot and add a fresh coating of oil. Add the pureed vegetables and season generously with salt. Brown over high heat, without stirring, for 5 to 7 minutes.

Add the chicken and brown on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. Once the chicken is browned all over add the the enchilada sauce, chili powder, smoked paprika, cumin, salt, pepper, cayenne, garlic and onion powder and bring everything to a boil.

December 2014USER RATINGS4 ServingsFacebookPinterestAlex LauFacebookTwitterPinterestEmailPrintBAs Best Macaroni and CheeseDont be alarmed if the sauce looks thin at first: It will continue to thicken as it bakes with the noodles. This recipe also easily doublesbecause one can't have too much mac 'n' cheese. This is part of BA's Best, a collection of our essential recipes.Ingredients4 Servings4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs) ounce Parmesan, finely grated (about  cup)2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided, plus more8 ounces cavatappi or other short curly pasta2  cups whole milk small onion, grated1 garlic clove, finely grated2 tablespoons all-purpose flour4 ounces Fontina cheese, grated (about 1 cup)4 ounces Gruyre, grated (about 1 cup)4 ounces sharp white cheddar, grated (about 1 cup) teaspoon English mustard powder (such as Colmans)Pinch of cayenne pepperPreparationPreheat oven to 350. Melt 2 Tbsp. butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add panko and cook, stirring, until crumbs are golden brown, 68 minutes (make sure to get them toasty brown; they wont darken much during baking). Transfer to a small bowl and toss with Parmesan, thyme leaves, and  tsp. salt.Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente (the noodles will continue to cook in the cheese sauce, so take them out a minute or two before you think theyre actually done). Drain pasta; let cool while you make the sauce.Bring milk to a bare simmer in a small saucepan; keep warm. Melt remaining 2 Tbsp. butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until onions are fragrant and beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle flour over and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture starts to stick to bottom of saucepan, about 1 minute. Add warm milk in a few additions, whisking to combine after each addition.Bring bchamel sauce to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, stirring, until sauce is thickened and doesnt feel grainy when a little bit is rubbed between your fingers, 68 minutes (cooking the flour thoroughly at this stage ensures a creamy sauce). Add Fontina, Gruyre, cheddar, mustard powder, cayenne, and  tsp. salt and stir until cheeses are melted and sauce is smooth.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Prepare a pastry bag with a large, round tip. If you don't have a pastry bag, a zip-top bag with a corner snipped off will work just fine.Combine butter, water, sugar, and salt in a pot and bring to boil over medium heat. Sprinkle in the flour and stir quickly with a wooden spoon. Stirring constantly, cook the dough for about 2 minutes, or until the dough forms a ball and pulls away from the sides of the pan and there is no more water pooled at the bottom. Remove from heat and let sit for 2 minutes, stirring four or five times to keep the dough from sticking to the bottom of the hot pan.Transfer the dough to a large bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat in the eggs one at a time. After all eggs are added, keep beating until the dough is a uniform consistency; it should be sticky and form soft peaks.Spoon the dough into a pastry bag or large zip-top bag with a big corner snipped off. Pipe the dough onto the prepared baking sheet in 6-inch long strips, about the width and length of an Italian sausage. Make sure to leave 2-inches of space between the pastries.Slide the baking sheet into the oven and bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375F (190C) and bake for another 30 minutes, or until pastries puff up and are a gorgeous golden color. Let cool completely on the baking sheet. Once completely cool, cut the clairs in half length-wise using a serrated bread knife.While the pastries are cooling, prepare pastry cream.In a heavy-bottomed 3-quart pot, whisk the milk and egg yolks together. Set aside. In a small bowl, sift together the flour, cornstarch, sugar, and salt.Set the pot of milk and yolks over medium flame, heating just until bubbles form around the edges and the surface starts to steam. Sprinkle in the flour mixture, whisking quickly to break up any lumps. Bring the pastry cream just to a boil, stirring constantly, and reduce heat to low. Cook until the cream thickens and heavily coats the back of a spoon. Remove from heat.Stir in the butter and vanilla, mixing until fully incorporated. Let pastry cream cool completely before using.Pour chocolate into a metal mixing bowl. Find a pot large enough to comfortably accommodate the metal mixing bowl without the whole bowl dropping inside. Set the bowl with the chocolate aside. Fill the empty pot halfway with water and set over medium heat to boil. Once the water is at a boil, reduce flame to low so that the water stays hot without boiling away.Add whipping cream, butter and mint extract to a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisking constantly, heat the cream to just about boiling, but dont let it actually come to a boil. You should see bubbles forming around the edges of the pot. If youre using a thermometer, the temperature of the cream should be about 180F (82C)Set the bowl of chocolate into the pot of boiling water, creating a double boiler. Immediately pour hot cream over chopped chocolate and whisk until completely smooth. Remove chocolate from heat and allow to cool for a 5 minutes.Remove the top half of the clairs and spoon pastry cream into the bottom portion of the puff pastry. Replace the top and set the pastries on a cooling rack with a piece of foil spread underneath.Drizzle the clairs with warm ganache, scooping up any extra icing from the foil and pouring it back into the bowl. If the ganache begins to harden, set it back over the double boiler and stir until it warms up and loosen a bit.Sprinkle the drizzled clairs with crushed candy canes, colored sugar, or other festive sprinkles.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Center two racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 425F (218C).
