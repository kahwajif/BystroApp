Press the crumbs into a 9- or 10-inch springform pan and refrigerate or freeze until set (about 30 minutes).While the crust is in the refrigerator, take out the mint chocolate chip ice cream and let it sit at room temperature for 15-ish minutes to soften up a bit. Scoop the softened ice cream into a medium bowl (you can use the same one as the cookie crumbs, if you like!) and stir the ice cream until it is smooth. You don’t want it overly melted here – just try to stir it all up so it is easy spreadable but is still cold and icy. Spread the ice cream over the cookie crust in an even layer. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, at least an hour.Follow the same step above with the chocolate ice cream and spread it on top of the mint chocolate chip ice cream (make sure the mint ice cream is thoroughly frozen so the layers don’t mix). Once the chocolate ice cream has been spread evenly, again cover with plastic wrap and freeze for 1-2 hours (or tightly covered up to a three days).When you are ready to serve the pie, whip the heavy cream into stiff peaks with the powdered sugar. To make the Andes mint curls, microwave one mint for five seconds on 20 or 30% power (this was adequate in my microwave but keep in mind that each microwave can cook hotter or cooler so test accordingly). Hold the mint nestled in a paper towel with one long thin edge exposed above the top of the paper towel. Take a vegetable peeler and gently shave off curls from the long, thin edge. Repeat this process until you have the desired amount of curls to garnish with (I shaved the curls early in the day and kept them on a plate in the freezer until I was ready to use them).Unmold the grasshopper pie from the springform pan and pile the whipped cream on top of the ice cream. Spread in large dollops over the top of the pie. Sprinkle with the curls. Cut the pie into slices and serve immediately. If you are planning to have leftovers, serve the whipped cream on each piece separately instead of the whole pie, as the whipped cream doesn’t fare as well being frozen on top of the pie for a long period of time.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine the crushed cookie crumbs and the butter together in a medium bowl until the cookie crumbs are well-moistened and the mixture looks and feels like wet sand.

Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir.

d'oeuvre"],"diets":[],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{"pairedWines":[],"pairingText":"","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Position a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350F (325F for a convection oven). Grease three 9- by 1-inch round baking pans or two 9- by 3-inch round baking pans or springform pans, line the bottoms with parchment paper or wax paper, grease again, and dust with flour.To make the batter: Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and, if using, nutmeg. In a large bowl, beat the butter on low speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Increase the speed to medium, gradually add the sugar, and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the vanilla. Add the flour mixture and milk alternately (4 portions for the flour; 3 portions for the milk) beginning and ending with the flour.In a large bowl, beat the egg whites on low until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium and beat until soft leaks form, 5 to 8 minutes. Fold one fourth of the egg whites into the batter, then gently fold in the remaining whites. Divide the batter equally between the prepared pans. Bake until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean and the cake springs back when lightly touched, 20 to 25 minutes for 3 pans or about 30 minutes for 2 pans.  Let cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove to wire racks and let cool completely, at least 1 hours. The cake can be wrapped and stored at room temperature for up to 1 day.  To make the filling: Place the egg yolks in a 2-quart saucepan and lightly beat. Add the sugar and beat until smooth. Add the butter and salt and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until thick enough to coat the back of the spoon and almost translucent, about 10 minutes. Do not boil.Remove from the heat and gradually stir in the bourbon and vanilla. Add the raisins, pecans, and, if using, coconut and/or cherries. Let cool, but do not chill before spreading.To assemble: If using 2 larger pans, use a serrated knife to cut each cake in half horizontally. Arrange a cake layer on a serving plate and spread with a third of the filling, about 1 cup. Top with a second cake, spread with half of the remaining filling, and place the third cake layer on top. If making a 3-layer cake, spread the remaining filling on top; for a 4-layer cake, leave the top bare and cover later with frosting. Place in a covered container. Let ripen in a cool place or the refrigerator for at least 2 days and up to 2 weeks, daily spooning any of the filling that seeps out back over top of the cake. For long term storage, place in the freezer for up to 4 months.  To make the frosting: In a small saucepan, stir the sugar and water over low heat until dissolved. Stop stirring, increase the heat to medium-high, and boil until it reaches the soft-ball stage and registers 238F on a candy thermometer. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, beat the egg whites on low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Add the salt or cream of tartar, increase the speed to medium-high, and beat until soft peaks form, about 1 minute. In a slow, steady stream, beat in the hot syrup.

Place over medium heat and stir for 1-2 minutes, or until the dough starts to pull away from the sides and bottom of the pan. It should be glossy.Transfer the dough to the bowl of a stand mixer and mix on low for 30 seconds. Add the eggs one at a time, only adding the next when the previous one has been totally incorporated. Preheat the oven to 375. Transfer the dough to a pastry bag fitted with a large French star tip. Line two baking pans with parchment paper. Pipe the first eclair in a straight line, onto the parchment-lined baking pan, until it is about 6 inches long. Pipe 5 more eclairs on that pan.

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

It costs about 42 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":438237,"title":"Gary Farrell Russian River Pinot Noir","description":"The 2007 Russian River Selection shows tremendous concentration and power from this blockbuster vintage.

If using this recommended recipe for pizza dough, here are the directions (ingredients can be found at the recipe link. The recipe yields enough dough for two crusts, so feel free to half it, or freeze the second dough for another time): In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a large mixing bowl), combine the warm water, yeast, honey, and olive oil. Add all of the white whole wheat flour, 1 cup of the all purpose flour, and salt. Mix on low speed (or by hand with a wooden spoon) just until dough comes together. Add remaining 1 cup flour a little at a time, just until the mixture forms a soft dough (you may not need the full cup.) If using a stand mixer, switch to a dough hook and mix on medium-low speed for about 10 minutes until smooth, adding a little flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the bowl. If mixing by hand, turn the dough onto a well-floured surface and knead for 12 minutes, incorporating additional flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking. Place the kneaded dough in a well-oiled bowl and turn to coat lightly with oil. Cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel and allow it to rest in a warm, draft-free place for 30 minutes. Divide dough into two equal portions, rolling each into a smooth ball. Place 1 ball on a baking sheet and cover with a damp towel. Let rest for 10 minutes. Wrap other ball in plastic and freeze for another time. (Dough will save for up to two months. When ready to bake, let come to room temperature and bake as directed.)Place rack in upper 1/3 of oven and preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or dust with cornmeal or flour.In a large bowl, whisk together the Buffalo sauce, garlic powder, and chili powder. Add shredded chicken and toss to coat.Place rested dough on a lightly floured work surface and roll into a 11x14-inch rectangle. Gently transfer the rolled dough to a prepared baking sheet. Top with the chicken-sauce mixture, leaving a 3/4 inch border around all size. Sprinkle on the mozzarella, blue cheese, celery, and red onion.

To Make the Herb Oil: Warm 2 cups of olive oil to about 100 degrees F. Add 1 cup of chopped fresh herbs or 1/3 cup dried herbs. Add the salt, pepper, and garlic. Stir together and allow to steep while you prepare the dough. You can keep any leftover herb oil in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks (it makes a fabulous dipping oil!).2. Stir together the flour, salt, and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Add the oil and water and mix on low speed with the paddle attachment until all the ingredients form a wet, sticky ball. Switch to the dough hook and mix on medium speed for 5 to 7 minutes, or as long as it takes to create a smooth, sticky dough. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. You may need to add additional flour to firm up the dough enough to clear the sides of the bowl, but the dough should still be quite soft and sticky.3. Sprinkle enough flour on the counter to make a bed about 6 inches square. Using a scraper or spatula dippedi n water, transfer the sticky dough to the bed of flour and dust liberally with flour, patting the dough into a rectangle. Wait 5 minutes for the dough to relax.4. Coat your hands with flour and stretch the dough from each end to twice its size. Fold it, letter style, over itself to return it to a rectangular shape. Mist the top  of the dough with spray oil, again dust with flour, and loosely cover with plastic wrap.5. Let rest for 30 minutes. Stretch and fold the dough again; mist with spray oil, dust with flour, and cover. After 30 minutes, repeat this one more time.6. Allow the covered dough to ferment on the counter for 1 hour. It should swell but not necessarily double in size.7. Line a 17 by 12-inch sheet pan with baking parchment and drizzle ¼ olive oil over the paper, and spread it with y our hands or a brush to cover the surface. Lightly oil your hands and, using a plastic or metal pastry scraper, lift the dough off teh counter and transfer it to the sheet pan, maintaining the rectangular shape as much as possible.8. Spoon half of the herb oil over the dough. Use your fingertips to dimple the dough and spread it to fill the pan simultaneously. Do not use the flat of your hands - only the fingertips - to avoid tearing or ripping the dough. Try to keep the thickness as uniform as possible across the surface. Dimpling allows you to degas only part of the dough while preserving gas in the non-dimpled sections. If the dough becomes too springy, let it rest for about 15 minutes and then continue dimpling. Don't worry if you are unable to fill the pan 100 perfect, especially the corners. As the dough relaxes and proofs, it will spread out naturally. Use more herb oil as needed to ensure that the entire surface is coated with oil.9. Loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough overnight (or for up to 3 days).10.Remove the pan from the refrigerator 3 hours before baking. Drizzle additional herb oil over the surface and dimple it in. This should allow you to fill the pan completely with the dough to a thickness of about ½-inch. Cover the pan with plastic and proof the dough at room temperature for 3 hours, or until the dough doubles in size, rising to a thickness of nearly 1 inch.11. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.12. Place the pan in the oven. Lower the oven setting to 450 degrees F and bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the pan 180 degrees and continue baking the focaccia for 5 to 10 minutes, or until it begins to turn a light golden brown. The internal temperature of the dough should register above 200 degrees F (measured in the center).13. Remove the pan from the oven and immediately transfer the focaccia out of the pan onto a cooling rack.14. Allow the focaccia to cool for at least 20 minutes before slicing or serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To Make the Herb Oil: Warm 2 cups of olive oil to about 100 degrees F.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Add 1 cup of chopped fresh herbs or 1/3 cup dried herbs.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the salt, pepper, and garlic.

golden brown.  Watch carefully as it can go from brown to burned very quickly.  Immediately pour the butter into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-low for 5-7 minutes, until it is room temperature.In a medium bowl, stir together flour, xanthan gum, cream of tartar, baking soda, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, and salt.  In a small bowl, whisk eggs and milk together.When the butter has reached room temperature, stop the mixer before adding 1 cup of granulated sugar and the brown sugar.  Beat on medium for about 2 minutes.  Stop and scrape down the bowl before beating for about another minute.  With the mixer running on low, drizzle in the egg mixture and mix until well combined, about 1 minute.Stop the mixer.  Add 1/3 of the flour mixture, then mix it in on low for about 15 seconds.  Add another third and mix it in, followed by the final third.  Remove the bowl from the mixer and stir the dough by hand once to make sure there are no dry ingredients lurking in the bottom of the bowl.  Form the dough into a ball in the center of the bowl.  Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Line 2 baking sheet with parchment.  In a small bowl, stir together remaining 2 teaspoons cinnamon and 3 tablespoons sugar.Form the dough into about golf ball sized balls (I like big cookies!) and roll the balls in the cinnamon sugar mixture until fully coated.  Place on the prepared sheet.  Cookies will spread a lot during baking, so space them as far apart as possible.  Once all the cookies are coated, bake for about 15 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through, until the cookies have spread, puffed, and cracked.  Cool completely on pans.  Cookies may be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or frozen, wrapped in parchment and foil and placed in a zipper bag for up to 4 months.  Thaw at room temperature about an hour or in a 350 degree F oven for 5-10 minutes for that fresh baked cookie taste.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium saucepan, cook the butter over medium heat swirling occasionally, until the butter turns deep golden brown.

flour, sugar and salt together in a medium bowl. Using your fingers, work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles coarse cornmeal mixed with pea-sized bits of cold butter. (If the butter gets too soft, refrigerate the mixture for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Use a fork to stir in the egg and water mixture until the dough just comes together. (If the dough is dry, add up to 1 tablespoon more cold water.) Divide the dough into two equal-sized disks, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour.                          For the filling: Peel, halve and core the apples. Cut each half into 4 wedges and place in a bowl with the lemon juice and cranberries, tossing to combine. Add the sugar and toss again to combine evenly.                          Melt the butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the apple mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer, about 2 minutes. Cover the pan and reduce the heat to medium-low, cooking until the apples soften and release most of their juices and the cranberries have burst, about 7 minutes.                          Strain the apple mixture into a colander set over the bowl, shaking it to collect as much of the juice as possible. Pour the liquid back into the skillet, add the cinnamon and ginger, and simmer over medium heat until thickened and lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes. Return the reduced juice and the apple mixture to the bowl and toss to recombine. Chill the filling until it cools completely, at least an hour and up to 2 days.                          To assemble the pie: On a lightly floured surface, roll each disk into an 11- to 12-inch circle. Lay each dough circle between two pieces of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes.                          Place a baking sheet on a rack positioned in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Line the bottom of a 9-inch pie dish with one of the dough discs and trim it to leave a 1/2-inch overhang on all sides. Stir the cornstarch into the filling and add it to the pan.                          Use a chef's knife, pizza cutter or fluted dough cutter to cut the second round into 1/2-inch thick strips. Lay strips of dough, evenly spaced, across the entire pie. Weave more strips of dough perpendicular through the previous strips to make a lattice or basket weave design across the entire pie. Trim the excess ends from the strips of dough. Pinch the bottom crust edge and lattice edge together, and flute the edge as desired. Brush the surface of the dough with egg and then sprinkle with sugar. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.                          Bake the pie on the preheated baking sheet until the crust is golden, 50 to 60 minutes. If the edges begin to brown too fast, cover them with strips of aluminum foil. Let the pie cool 1 hour before serving. Once completely cooled, the pie keeps well at room temperature (covered) for 24 hours, or refrigerated for up to 4 days.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"For the crust","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Whisk the flour, sugar and salt together in a medium bowl.

Add the cream cheese and blend until the mixture is sandy. Add the butter and blend until the mixture resembles coarse meal.In a small bowl, combine the ice water, egg, oil and vanilla.  Slowly pour into the food processor, mixing until the dough just forms a ball. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, divide it in half and pat into two small disks. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.On a lightly floured surface, roll the disk of Cream Cheese Pastry to about 1/8 inch thick.  Fit the round into a 10-inch pie plate and trim the overhang to 1-inch. Fold the overhang under the rim and crimp decoratively. Line the pie shells with foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans.Bake the shell for 30 minutes, or until lightly colored around the edges. Remove the foil and weights and bake for another 5 minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool slightly.Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, combine the cream,cinnamon sticks & cloves, and simmer over low heat for about 25 minutes, until reduced to 1 1/4 cups.

Slowly add the cooled cream and beat until just blended.In a stainless-steel bowl, using clean beaters, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Slowly beat in the granulated sugar and continue beating until the whites are stiff and glossy. Fold one-quarter of the beaten egg whites into the pumpkin filling, then fold in the remaining whites. Pour the filling into the pie shell and smooth the surfaces.Bake for about 1 hour, or until the custard is lightly golden and just beginning to crack all over.  Remove from the oven and cool completely on a wire rack.In a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the sugar and water.  Bring to a boil, stirring just until the sugar dissolves.  Let the mixture continue to boil, without stirring, until the temperature registers 220 on a candy thermometer, about 5-8 minutes.In a large stainless-steel bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites at medium speed until firm.

Lay the bacon on a rimmed baking sheet and cook in the oven for 10 to 20 minutes, depending on how crisp you like your bacon.Remove the pan from the oven and use tongs to transfer the bacon to a paper towel–lined plate to drain and cool. Set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 200°F.Pour the water and vinegar into a large pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and use a slotted spoon to gently lower the eggs into the boiling water.Simmer the eggs (reduce the heat to medium-low if necessary) for exactly 12 minutes.While the eggs cook, set the croissants on a rimmed baking sheet and place them in the oven to warm (reassemble the croissants so they are whole—you don’t want the interior to get toasty and hard).Transfer the cooked eggs to a sieve and place them under cold running water until they’re cool enough to handle (you don’t want the eggs to be cold—they need to be warm).Peel the eggs, place them in the bowl of a food processor, and purée until they’re creamy. Add the mayonnaise, season with salt and pepper, and continue to process until the mixture is well combined.Divide the egg salad among the bottom halves of each croissant. Top each with 4 pieces of arugula and 2 pieces of bacon. Cover with the top halves of the croissants and eat immediately. ","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 350°F.

Foam of great persistence. Very fruity aromas, especially of white fruit (acid apple and pear) on shades of peel of citrics and white flowers. In the background, some spicy notes owed to ageing (cinnamon) and cookies. It is a well-structured \"cava\" in the mouth. Well picked up over its acidity that tenses it overall from beginning to end. The bubble lends a creamy feeling, and it gives volume and softness to the structure that returns acidity and widens the aromas of white fruits and spices that are repeated in the mouth. Its balanced end harmonizes its acidity, and leaves a memory of freshness and volume owing to its light sugar content","price":"$16.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440298-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8073684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbohigas-brut-reserva-cava%2F131248"}]},"instructions":"Preheat grill to medium-low.
