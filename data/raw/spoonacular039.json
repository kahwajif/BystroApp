Stir lemon mixture into chickpea mixture with a fork until thoroughly combined. (This step is optional, but produces a slightly fluffier falafel).Fill a skillet with oil to a depth of 1 ½ inches.

Kill your lobster by the officially sanctioned method of putting it in the freezer for about two hours to reduce it to a torpid state, then put it straight into a large pan of rapidly boiling water (salt water in the ratio of 2 tablespoons of salt per 4 cups water). Cooking times are 12 minutes for a minimum-size lobster of 1 pound, 15 minutes for anything up to 1 1/2 pounds, and an extra 5 minutes for every pound after that. Then let cool.2. Twist off the claws, crack them with a hammer or nutcracker, and remove all the meat. Set this aside. The body of the lobster should be split lengthwise along the lateral line with a large, heavy, and very sharp knife. This is most easily done if you lay the lobster on its back on a large wooden board, press the point of the knife into the tip of the tail, and bring the knife down the length of the lobster, bisecting it evenly between the two sets of legs—do this carefully, so as not to damage the shell. Once you are through the flesh to the shell at the back of the lobster, press hard on the knife with your free hand to cut through the shell. You may want to use a pair of kitchen scissors to snip through any bits of shell that are not quite cut through.3. Carefully remove the tail meat from each half of the lobster, chop coarsely, and add to the claw meat. Scrape out any brown meat from the head, along with any pink coral, and add that to the white meat from the claws and tail. Remove the nasty bits and discard. You should be left with 2 empty shell halves, with plenty of space in the head and tail cavities to replace the finished meat.4. In a frying pan, cook the shallots in the butter over medium heat until soft and lightly browned. Add the white wine and simmer until reduced to a scant tablespoon of liquid. Stir in the béchamel sauce and the cream, if using, plus the mustard and tarragon, and allow to bubble in the pan for just a minute. Remove from the heat and stir in three-quarters of the cheese and the cayenne pepper. Then mix in all the meat from the lobster until it is well coated in the thermidor sauce. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.5. Pile the meat back in the shell, sprinkle over the remaining cheese, and place under a hot broiler for 5 to 10 minutes, until brown and bubbling.

Remove the meat from the pan, brush all over with the mustard and leave to cool.\nMince the mushrooms in a food processor. Place the pan back on the heat with the rest of the oil and add the mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper and fry over a high heat for 5 mins until the excess moisture has evaporated and you have a thick paste. Season, transfer the mushrooms to a bowl and leave to cool.\nLay 2-3 large sheets of cling film overlapping each other on a clean surface. Lay the slices of prosciutto overlapping lengthways in 2 rows of 3. Sit one of the pieces of venison in the middle of the prosciutto. Press the mushrooms over the venison and sandwich with the other piece of venison. Roll into a tight package (see step-by-step images above) and leave to chill in the fridge.\nLay out another couple of pieces of cling film. Trim the pancakes into squares and lay them overlapping on the cling film. Remove the cling film from the prosciuttowrapped meat and place the meat on top of the pancakes. Roll up tightly again in cling film, then place in the fridge to hold its shape.\nRoll the pastry out to a large rectangle big enough to easily wrap the meat in, then brush all over with egg yolk. Unwrap the cling film from the pancake-wrapped venison and roll to completely encase in the pastry. Tuck the ends in and trim any excess. Lay out more cling film and finally roll into a tight package to get an evenly thick log. Tie the ends of cling film to keep the package tight and leave in the fridge overnight or in the freezer for an hour. Can be made to this point up to a day in advance.\nWhen ready to cook, heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Remove the cling film and brush the Wellington all over with egg yolk. Sit it on a baking tray lined with baking paper and lightly score in a feathered fashion. Bake for 50 mins for medium rare, dropping to 200C/180C fan/ gas 7 if the pastry becomes too brown. Remove from the oven to rest for 20 mins. If you prefer the meat well done, turn oven off after 40 mins and leave to rest inside. Trim the end of the pastry, carefully carve in slices about 3-4cm thick and serve.\nTo make the pancakes for the Wellingtons, tip 100g plain flour into a bowl. Beat 1 egg with 250ml milk and gradually whisk into the flour until smooth. Stir in some snipped chives and a handful of chopped flat-leaf parsley just before cooking, then heat a drop of oil in a large non-stick frying pan and swirl around some of the batter to make a thin pancake. When the pancake is done, make another 3 and set aside. The pancakes can be made 2 days in advance.\nFor a creamy mash, chunk 1kg floury potatoes. Place in a pan of cold salted water and bring to the boil. Simmer for about 15 mins until completely tender, then drain and return to the pan over a low heat for a few mins to dry out. Press the potatoes through a ricer and gradually add 150ml warm double cream and 50g butter. Season to taste and serve, or leave to cool and reheat in a pan or microwave with a touch more cream and butter. The mash can be made a day in advance.\nFor the carrots, peel and trim 24 baby carrots (a mix of white and orange if you can find them) but keep them whole. Boil for 2-3 mins in salted water until just tender, then drain. Heat a large knob of butter in a frying pan and sizzle the carrots for 8-10 mins until golden. Serve the carrots or cool and reheat in a pan with a touch more butter or in the microwave. The carrots can be made a day in advance.\nTo make a delicious port sauce, sweat 1 finely chopped shallot in a little butter with a thyme sprig. Pour in 300ml port and reduce by two-thirds, then add 600ml fresh chicken stock and reduce again by two-thirds until syrupy. Strain into another saucepan ready to be reheated. The sauce can be made 2 days in advance and reheated in the saucepan, adding a splash more stock if too thick.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat half the oil in a frying pan and quickly seal the venison for about 2 mins on each side until browned.","ingredients":[{"id":4582,"name":"cooking oil","image":"vegetable-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Remove the meat from the pan, brush all over with the mustard and leave to cool.","ingredients":[{"id":2046,"name":"mustard","image":"regular-mustard.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Mince the mushrooms in a food processor.","ingredients":[{"id":11260,"name":"mushrooms","image":"mushrooms.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404771,"name":"food processor","image":"food-processor.png"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Place the pan back on the heat with the rest of the oil and add the mushrooms.

Combine with 1 1/2 cups cider in a medium saucepan over medium heat; cover and cook until softened, about 8 minutes. Uncover and continue cooking until the apples are tender and the cider is almost completely reduced, about 5 minutes. Puree with an immersion blender or in a food processor until smooth. Measure the sauce; you should have 1 cup. (Boil to reduce further, if necessary.) Let cool slightly.                          Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon, salt and nutmeg in a medium bowl.                          Beat 2/3 cup granulated sugar and the shortening in another bowl with a mixer on medium speed until sandy. Beat in the egg and yolk, then gradually mix in the applesauce, scraping the bowl. Beat in half of the flour mixture, then the buttermilk and vanilla, and then the remaining flour mixture. Mix to make a sticky dough; do not overmix.                          Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper and pat into a 7-by-11-inch rectangle, about 1/2 inch thick. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.                          Meanwhile, make the glaze: Simmer the remaining 1 cup cider in a small saucepan over medium heat until reduced to 1/4 cup. Whisk in the confectioners' sugar until smooth and glossy, then set aside. Mix the remaining 1 cup granulated sugar and 2 teaspoons cinnamon in a shallow bowl; set aside for the topping.                          Heat 2 inches of vegetable oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Cut the chilled dough into 12 rounds, using a floured 2 1/2- or 3-inch biscuit cutter, then cut out the middles with a 1-inch cutter (or use a doughnut cutter). Slip 2 or 3 doughnuts at a time into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side, adjusting the heat as needed. Transfer to the paper towels to drain.                          Dip one side of each doughnut in the cider glaze, letting the excess drip off; dip just the glazed side in the cinnamon-sugar or roll all over in cinnamon-sugar, if desired.

The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.This wine has a broad range of food pairings, whether alone with some well chosen cheeses, richer fish preparations or a good old steak on the barbeque.","price":"$42.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438099-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":8,"score":0.8400000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fdutton-goldfield-dutton-ranch-pinot-noir-2014%2F154141"}]},"instructions":"Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.

In a small bowl, stir together ¼ cup of the warmed milk and one teaspoon of the sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the milk and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes until foamy.2. In a large bowl or the mixing bowl of an electric mixer, vigorougly whisk together 3 cups of the flour (reserving additional flour for Step #4), the salt, spices, and the remaining ¼ cup of sugar.3. Create a well in the flour and add the foamy yeast, butter, eggs and the remaining ½ cup of milk. Using a wooden spoon or the paddle attachment of your mixer, mix the ingredients on low speed until well incorporated. The mixture should be shaggy and quite sticky. Add in the currants and orange zest.4. If you are using a stand mixer, switch to the dough hook attachment and start to knead on low speed. (If not using a mixer, use your hands to knead.) Slowly sprinkle in additional flour, a tablespoon at a time, kneading to incorporate after each addition, until the flour is still slightly tacky, but is no longer completely sticking to your fingers when you work with it.5. Form a ball of dough in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. let sit, covered, at room temperature (or in a warm, draft-free spot) for about 2 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size.6. Press down on the dough to gently compress it. Divide the dough into 16 equal pieces. Take the individual pieces and form them into rolls, placing them 1½ inches apart from each other baking sheets.

Butter the paper.  Set aside.Place the dark chocolate and salt in the bowl of a food processor, and process until the chocolate is in tiny pieces.  Crack the eggs into a measuring cup with a spout, and add the vanilla to the eggs.Place the sugar and coffee (or water) into a small saucepan and bring it to a rolling boil.  With the processor on, add the boiling sugar syrup to the chocolate, processing until the chocolate has completely melted.  Add the butter piece by piece, processing until smooth.  Finally, add the eggs and vanilla.  Process until the mixture is very smooth.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing with a spatula. Set the cake pan into a larger roasting pan. Put the pans in the oven, and pour hot water into the larger pan, reaching about halfway up the sides of the cake pan.Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the center no longer moves when shaken gently.  Remove from the larger pan, and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely in the pan.  Transfer to the fridge once it becomes lukewarm to the touch to chill for 20 minutes to 1 hour.While the cake is chilling, make the ganache by placing the chopped chocolate into a heat proof bowl.  Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium low heat, until it just boils.  Remove from the heat, and pour over the chopped chocolate.  Whisk until the chocolate has melted.  Add the vanilla and salt, whisking until smooth.Once the cake is chilled, run a sharp knife around the sides to release the cake. Cover the cake with plastic wrap, and unmold it onto a cookie sheet.  Invert a wire rack over the cake and flip it over, so the bottom of the cake is on the wire rack.  Place the wire rack on top of the cookie sheet used previously.Pour the chocolate ganache over the chilled cake, covering the entire cake.  Because the cake is cold, it should set up nicely, but you'll probably have a bit drip down through the wire rack, which is fine.  Place the glazed cake on the cookie sheet in the fridge until the ganache is set, about 20 minutes.Carefully transfer the set cake onto a serving plate, and serve with whipped cream, fresh berries, or a contrasting flavored ice cream.

Grease a square 8x8 baking dish or one 8 inch cake pan.Stir together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt in large bowl. Add eggs, buttermilk, oil and vanilla. Beat on medium speed of mixer for two minutes. Beat in the hot coffee. Evenly spread the batter into the prepared baking dish and bake 25 to 30 minutes or until the cake no longer jiggles in the center. Remove and allow to cool 5 minutes. Then poke the cake all over with a fork and evenly pour the Kahlua all over the cake. Cover the baking dish and place in the fridge.To make the chocolate mousse, in a microwave safe bowl add the chocolate, butter and 2 tablespoons water. Microwave on 30 second intervals, stirring after each, until melted and smooth. Set aside to cool. In a small sauce pan whisk together the egg yolks, 2 tablespoons water and sugar. Place on the stove over medium heat and stir constantly until the sauce thickens slightly and just coats the back of a spoon, about 2-3 minutes. Stir the melted chocolate into egg mixture until completely smooth. Place in the fridge while you whip the cream.Place 1 1/2 cups of the cream in the bowl of a stand mixer and whip cream until stiff peaks form. Make sure not to over-beat, cream will then become lumpy and butter-like. Now add half the whipped cream to the cooled chocolate mixture. Gently fold the cream into the chocolate until no more streaks remain. Add the remaining cream and gently fold into the mousse. Place in the fridge.Now add the remaining cream to a clean bowl and whip just as you did earlier. Once whipped add 1 tablespoon powdered sugar and whip until combined. Place in the fridge.Make the chocolate coffee caramel, whisk together heavy cream and vanilla in a small bowl. Set aside. Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil. Once it begins to boil watch closely and whisk until the mixture starts to smell like caramel and turn a golden color, and then to a light brown. This will take about 5-6 minutes. When you see that it has started to turn brown, slowly pour in the cream mixture, whisking constantly and quickly. The sugar will harden around the whisk, dont worry, it will melt. Just keep whisking! Continue to heat over medium-high until mixture has thickened and is a light caramel color, about 5 minutes more (don't let it get too thick, it will thicken as it sits). Remove from the heat and stir in the, coffee, chocolate chips and vanilla.To assemble the cakes line up 6 glasses or glass jars. Drizzle the bottom of each jar with 1 tablespoon of the coffee caramel, then crumble in a layer of the cake. Drizzle that with another tablespoon or so of caramel, then add a layer of mouse and a layer of whipped cream. Repeat the layers 2 more times finishing with a layer of whipped cream. Then add crumbled cake to the top of the whipped cream and drizzle with more caramel sauce. Refrigerate 2 hours or until ready to serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the cake, heat oven to 350F.
