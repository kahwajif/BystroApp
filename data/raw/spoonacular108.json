Heat the milk until lukewarm.  Add yeast and stir, set aside for at least 5 to 10 minutes.  In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, sugar, and lemon zest.  Make a well in the center and add the egg, melted butter, and milk mixture.  Stir until mixture comes together.  Turn out onto a floured surface and knead for 10 to 15 minutes, until dough is smooth.  Lightly oil a bowl, put in dough, and turn to coat.  Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  After dough has chilled, roll out dough on a floured surface to a large circle, 1/4\" thick.  Line the prepared tart pan with the dough.  Refrigerate.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.To make the filling, pour the milk in a medium saucepan.  Split the vanilla bean in half, scrape the seeds from inside, and add seeds and bean to milk.  If using extract instead, add extract to milk.  Slowly bring to a boil over medium heat, then remove from heat and set aside to cool slightly.  In a medium bowl, sift the cornstarch and add a small amount of water to make a paste.  Strain the milk into the cornstarch and discard the vanilla bean.  Stir until smooth.

Add in the diced leek and sauté until starting to caramelize and get crispy, about 8 minutes. Add in the Stirring often so they don’t burn. Add in the garlic and sauté another 30 seconds then once done add to the bowl with the mashed potatoes. Mix well and then scoop out about 2 ½ Tbsp sized amounts of potato mixtyre and flatten into a patty, about 2” across.In a small bowl whisk the egg and in another bowl place the panko. Dip one patty in the egg and then into the panko and cover well with panko. Repeat with remaining patties. You should have 10-12 patties.Bake for 12 minutes and then carefully flip and bake for another 12. Keep warm until ready to serve.Steam the lobsters. Bring salted water to a boil in a large pot with a steamer basket and add the lobsters. Let them steam for 11 minutes.Remove from the pot and let cool slightly. Twist the tails off gently and rinse the lobsters out. Remove the claws and legs. Using kitchen scissors cut the lobster tail on the underside down the middle. Carefully remove the tail meat.

To prepare the tomato sauce, first pour the tomatoes into a mesh sieve or fine colander and let them drain off excess juice for a minute. Transfer drained tomatoes to the bowl of a food processor. Add the basil, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper flakes. Pulse the mixture about 10 times, until the tomatoes have broken down to an easily spreadable consistency. Pour the mixture into a bowl for later (you should have about 2 cups sauce).\nRinse out the food processor and return it to the machine. Pour half of the cottage cheese (1 cup) into the processor and blend it until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer the mixture to large mixing bowl. No need to rinse out the bowl of the food processor this time; just put it back onto the machine because youll need it later.\nWarm 2 tablespoons olive oil a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the chopped onion and  teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onion is tender and translucent, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\nAdd the artichoke to the skillet, then add a few large handfuls of spinach. Cook, stirring and tossing frequently, until the spinach has wilted. Repeat with remaining spinach. Continue cooking for about 12 minutes, stirring frequently, until the spinach has dramatically reduced in volume and very little moisture remains in the bottom of the pan.\nTransfer the spinach artichoke mixture to the bowl of the food processor and pulse until the contents are finely chopped (but not pured!), about 12 to 15 times. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of whipped cottage cheese. Top with remaining cottage cheese and mix well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Now its lasagna assembly time!\nSpread  cup tomato sauce evenly over the bottom of an 8-by-8 or 9-by-9 inch square baker. Layer three lasagna noodles on top, overlapping their edges as necessary. Spread half of the spinach mixture evenly over the noodles. Top with  cup tomato sauce, then sprinkle  cup shredded cheese on top.\nTop with three more noodles, followed by the remaining spinach mixture. Sprinkle  cup shredded cheese on top. (Were skipping the tomato sauce in this layer.) Top with three more noodles, then spread the remaining tomato sauce over the top so the noodles are evenly covered. Sprinkle evenly with 1 cup shredded cheese.\nWrap the lasagna with a layer of parchment paper over the top (or cover tightly with aluminum foil, but dont let the foil touch the cheese). Bake, covered, for 18 minutes, then remove the cover, rotate the pan by 180 degrees and continue cooking for about 12 more minutes, until the top is turning spotty brown. Remove from oven and let the lasagna cool for 15 minutes before sprinkling with chopped basil and slicing.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.

                        In a shallow bowl, mix 1/2 cup flour, salt and pepper. Add chicken, one piece at a time, and toss to coat; shake off excess. In a 6-qt. stockpot, heat oil over medium-high heat. Brown chicken in batches on all sides; remove from pan.                                                                                                                                                       Add onion, carrots and celery to same pan; cook and stir 6-8 minutes or until onion is tender. Add garlic; cook and stir 1 minute longer. Stir in 1/4 cup flour until blended. Gradually add stock, stirring constantly. Stir in wine, sugar, bay leaves and peppercorns. Return chicken to pan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, 20-25 minutes or until chicken juices run clear.                                                                                                                                                       Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk flour, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, whisk milk and melted butter until blended. Add to flour mixture; stir just until moistened (do not overmix). Drop by rounded tablespoons onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet; set aside.                                                                                                                                                       Remove chicken from stockpot; cool slightly. Discard bay leaves and skim fat from soup. Remove skin and bones from chicken and discard. Using two forks, coarsely shred meat into 1- to 1-1/2-in. pieces; return to soup. Cook, covered, on high until mixture reaches a simmer.                                                                                                                                                       Drop dumplings on top of simmering soup, a few at a time. Reduce heat to low; cook, covered, 15-18 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center of dumplings comes out clean (do not lift cover while simmering). Gently stir in cream, parsley and thyme. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste.
