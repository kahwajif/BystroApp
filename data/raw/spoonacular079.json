Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti.

Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses.

Purée the raspberries in a food processor or a food mill. Strain the purée through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl, discarding the seeds. There should be about 2 cups purée.2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the raspberry purée, sugar, water, and salt. Churn in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Spread the sorbet evenly in a 9 1/2-inch angel food cake pan. Freeze until hard, at least 2 hours, depending on your freezer.3. To unmold, run a knife around the inside and outside edges of the sorbet . Grasp the pan by the inner tube and lift the ring of sorbet from the outer part of the pan. Run a knife between the sorbet and the bottom of the pan. Quickly invert the pan, letting the sorbet fall onto a plastic wrap or parchment-lined unrimmed baking sheet or cutting board. Wrap well and refreeze until you are ready to assemble and serve the cake.Make the angel food cake4. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Sift together the cake flour and the ground ginger. Add the salt.5. In the bowl of an electric mixer, whip the egg whites on low speed until frothy. Add the cream of tartar. Increase speed to medium-high speed for a stand mixer, high with a handheld mixer, and whip until the egg whites are smooth, white, and just beginning to hold their shape. They will still be a bit bubbly and airy. Slowly whip in the sugar and continue to whip until stiff, satiny peaks form.6. Transfer the whites to a large bowl. Add the dry ingredients and carefully begin folding them together. When half incorporated, add the lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Continue to fold until completely incorporated.7. Carefully spread the batter in a 9 1/2-inch angel food cake pan. Tap the cake on the counter to eliminate any air bubbles. Bake until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Invert the cake onto its feet and cool upside down. (If your cake pan does not have feet, invert it onto a glass bottle to keep it from lying directly on the countertop.) Let cool completely.8. To unmold, run a knife around the inside and outside edges of the cake. Hold the inner tube and pull the cake from the outer ring. Run a knife between the cake and the bottom of the pan. Carefully pick up the cake and invert it onto a large plate.Assemble the cake9. Combine the cream, sugar, and vanilla in a bowl and whip until soft peaks form.10. Slice the cake in half horizontally and set the top half aside. Spread about 1/2 cup of the whipped cream over the bottom half of the cake. Slide the sorbet off the baking sheet on top of the cream. Spread 1/2 cup of cream over the sorbet. Place the second half of the angel food cake on top. Spread the remaining cream on top.11. Garnish with the fresh raspberries. Slice with a serrated knife and serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the raspberry sorbet","ingredients":[{"id":9302,"name":"raspberries","image":"raspberries.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Purée the raspberries in a food processor or a food mill.

Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir. Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon.

Make the short ribs: Preheat the oven to 350. Season the short ribs evenly with 1 teaspoons of salt. Working in 2 batches, heat 1 tablespoon of the canola oil over medium-high heat in a large saucepan. When the oil is hot, add half of the short ribs and brown on all sides, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer the short ribs to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Pour the rendered short rib fat into a small bowl and set aside. Deglaze the saucepan with  cup of water and pour over the short ribs. Repeat with the remaining canola oil and short ribs.2. Wipe the saucepan clean and return to medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the rendered fat. Add the onion, carrot, fennel and garlic cloves, and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the spices and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more. Pour the vegetables into the baking dish with the ribs, add the orange zest and pour the remaining water over. Cover and cook in the preheated oven until the short ribs are tender, 2 to 3 hours.3. While the short ribs are cooking, make the caramelized onions: In a large, wide Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, add the canola oil and rendered short rib fat. Add the onions and cook, stirring often, until golden brown and caramelized, 15 to 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and transfer half of the caramelized onions to a paper towel-lined plate. Season with salt.4. Make the mujadara: To the remaining caramelized onions, add the lentils, 3 cups of the water, orange juice and zest, star anise, cinnamon stick, bay leaf, ground cardamom and allspice. Season with  teaspoon of salt, then raise the heat and bring to a boil. Cover, lower the heat to a simmer and cook until the lentils are tender and most of the water has absorbed, 35 to 40 minutes.5. When the lentils are ready, add the rice, black-eyed peas and remaining 1 cups of water. Cover and simmer until the rice is done, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit, covered, for 5 minutes, before removing the lid and fluffing with a fork. Add the reserved caramelized onions, then taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Makes about 7 cups mujadara.6. To serve: Transfer the mujadara to a large serving platter. Slice the short ribs and place them on top of themujadara, along with some of the braising liquid. Garnish with the scallions, parsley and cilantro.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the short ribs: Preheat the oven to 35","ingredients":[{"id":10013149,"name":"beef short ribs","image":"beef-short-ribs.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Season the short ribs evenly with 1 teaspoons of salt.

For the chicken: In the bowl of a small food processor add the olive oil, tomato-vegetable juice, fennel seeds, oregano, salt, onion powder, paprika and garlic. Puree until it forms a rough paste. Place the chicken pieces in a plastic resealable bag. Add the paste to the bag and rub the marinade all over the chicken pieces. Seal the bag and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or up to 8 hours.                          Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place one rack in the middle of the oven and another in the top third of the oven.                          Remove the chicken from the bag and place on a rimmed baking sheet. Place in the oven on the middle rack and bake for 30 minutes.                          For the salad: In a large bowl, toss the bread with the olive oil and 1/2 cup of the cheese. Scatter the bread cubes around the chicken pieces. Place the tray back in the oven, this time on the top third, until the bread is toasted and the chicken is golden brown and an internal thermometer placed in the meat reads 160 degrees F, 15 to 20 minutes.                          Rest the chicken for 10 minutes and reserve all of the juices in the tray.                          In the same large bowl add the tomatoes, basil, lemon juice, fennel, the toasted bread cubes, the remaining 1 cup cheese and all of the juices from the chicken tray. Add a bit of olive oil if needed, depending on the amount of juice from the chicken. Toss well with a large spoon.

Set asideIn the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl with your hand mixer, beat the eggs and sugar on medium speed until thick and a pale yellow. This will take 3-5 minutes. Beat in the vanilla extract. Combine the milk with the melted butter. With the mixer on low speed, alternately add the flour mixture (in three additions), with the milk and melted butter (in two additions), beginning and ending with the flour. The dough at this point will look more like a batter and be quite soft. Cover with plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. The flour will absorb more liquid and the fat will firm up making it easier to roll out.Once the dough is firm enough to roll, place the dough on a floured surface, and with a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thick.  Cut the dough using a donut cutter or a 3-inch biscuit cutter. Cut out smaller holes in then center of each piece.Place the donuts on a lightly floured baking sheet, lined with parchment or wax paper.Meanwhile heat about 2 inches of frying oil (canola, vegetable, or peanut) in a heavy bottom pan to 375F. Set up a cooling rack over a sheet pan for the donuts to drain on. Gently slide the donuts into the hot oil, only a few at a time. Fry each side until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Carefully remove the donuts from the hot fat with tongs or a slotted spoon. Place on the cooling rack to drain over a sheet pan. After the donuts have cooled a few minutes, you can dip them in the ganache. Place the chocolate and the cream in a microwave safe bowl. Heat in the microwave in 10 second bursts, stirring well after each heating, until the chocolate is melted, smooth, and glossy. It will be thick.

great choices for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Luna Nuda Pinot Grigio with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

For the Beer Batter:                          Mix the flour, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Gradually add in the beer while whisking. Set aside and let the batter rest for 15 minutes before using.                          For Cream Sauce:                          Add the mayonnaise and crema to a medium bowl. Whisk in the lemon zest, lemon juice and water. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper (can be made 3 days ahead, covered and refrigerated).                          For the Fish:                          In a large skillet, over medium heat, add enough oil to reach a depth of 1-inch. Heat the oil until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F or when the end of a wooden spoon sizzles when inserted into the oil.                          On a large plate, combine the flour and salt. Season the fish pieces all over with salt and pepper and coat with the flour. Working in batches, dip the fillets in the beer batter and coat on both sides. Fry in the hot oil until golden brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain.

Flank steak is not meant to be cooked until well done; doing so will see it become dry and tough so I recommend medium rare as the best choice but no more than medium for best results.

Line an 8-by-8-inch baking pan with aluminum foil, spray with cooking spray; set aside. Bars -In a large, microwave-safe bowl add the white chocolate, butter, and heat to melt,about 2 minutes on high power. Stop to check and stir after 1 minute, and then heat in 20-second bursts, stopping to stir after each burst, until mixture can be stirred smooth. White chocolate is very prone to scorching and seizing up, so watch it carefully and don't overheat. Wait momentarily before adding the egg so you don't scramble it. Add the egg, sugar, vanilla,and whisk until combined. Add thepumpkin, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, and whiskuntil combined. Add the flour, optional salt, andstir until just combined; don't overmix. Turn batter out into prepared pan, smoothing the top lightly with a spatula. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean, or with a few moist crumbs, but no batter.In the last 10 minutes of baking, make the glaze. Glaze- Brown the butter(click for tutorial).Cook butter over medium-high heat in a small saucepan until it's amber to brown in color, about 5 minutes depending on pan size, but watch it closely so you don't burn it. I swirl the pan in the last minute or so to make sure I can really see the color changes. Butter will go through stages of hissing, sputtering, and making noise until the water cooks off at which point the browning occurs. Butter will smell nutty and aromatic. Transfer butter, including brown bits at the bottom of the pan (they're flavor powerhouses, keep them) from pan to large mixing bowl which stops any carryover cooking. Add the confectioners' sugar, vanilla bean paste, optional salt, and slowly add the milk, whisking until smooth or beat with a handheld electric mixer. As necessary, add additional cream(or confectioners' sugar) to reach desired glaze consistency. Glaze should be of medium thickness and easily pourable. Evenly pour glaze over bars (they don't have to be cooled first), smoothing it lightly with a spatula if necessary, but glaze will likely just slide into place. Allow bars to cool in pan uncovered for at least 2 to 3 hours, (or overnight and cover with a sheet of foil) before slicing and serving so glaze canset up.Bars will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 6 months.

Clip your thermometer to the side of the pot and let it heat up until it reaches 375 degrees.While the chicken is marinating and the oil is heating up, you can get the sauce together by adding the sesame oil to a medium pot. Add the ginger and garlic and cook for 30 seconds, stirring. Add in the rest of the sauce ingredients except for the cornstarch, stir and bring to a boil.Mix the cornstarch together in a small dish with 3 tablespoons of water, then slowly pour into the sauce while whisking. Bring to a boil once again then turn the heat off, cover and set aside.When your oil reaches about 375 degrees you can start frying the chicken. Take the chicken out of the marinade a few pieces at a time and carefully add them to the oil.
