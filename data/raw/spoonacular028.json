The most difficult part of this recipe is browning the noodles, and not burning them. It doesn't take long before the noodles are burnt, it seems to happen only a second or two after they are toasted, watch them carefully. Add toasted Ramen noodles to salad. Add slivered almonds to salad, use your hands and toss the cabbage, green onions, toasted ramen noodles, and almond slivers well.To make the dressing, use a medium sized bowl, or a shake bottle if you have it, add sugar, vinegar, dry ginger, dry mustard powder, Worechester sauce, and vegetable oil. Whisk thoroughly, it may seem the sugar won't dissolve, it will. If you wanted, I bet you could substitute the sugar with either equal or splenda. Once the sugar as completely dissovled pour over slaw, and mix well.I have taken Asian Crunchy Slaw to a couple of pot lucks recently with hopes that I would have a little extra to take home, and this didn't happen.

Traditional techniques, including native yeasts, extended maceration, aging in French oak barrels and bottling without filtration, enhanced the wine's complexity. This wine is delicious with many entrees and cheeses. One of our favorite food pairings is roast turkey with a wild mushroom and walnut stuffing. Roast leg of lamb, rubbed with fragrant herbs and spices, or grilled pork loin also marry perfectly with the wine's luscious flavors.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438573-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.7473684210526317,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Frobert-mondavi-napa-merlot-1999%2F51817"}]},"instructions":"Place the meat in the pressure cooker and leave the lid off.

dish"],"diets":["lacto ovo vegetarian"],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"Make the custard: In a saucepan, warm the milk, vanilla bean and seeds over low heat. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl; beat in the flour. Remove the vanilla bean and whisk the milk into the egg mixture. Pour back into the saucepan and whisk over medium heat until the cream is thick, about 8 minutes. Transfer the custard to a bowl; lay plastic wrap on the surface and cool in the refrigerator for about 3 hours. Transfer to a large pastry bag fitted with a wide round tip.                          Prepare the millefoglie: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cut the puff pastry into eighteen 3-inch rounds using a cookie cutter or a paring knife. Place the rounds on parchment paper-lined baking sheets, prick with a fork and bake until golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside to cool; leave the oven on.                          Make the maraschino sauce: Combine the black cherries, pineapple juice and maraschino cherry juice in a small saucepan. Bring the liquid to a simmer over medium heat and cook until the cherries are softened, about 5 minutes. Carefully transfer the mixture to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Strain the puree and set aside to cool. Store any extra sauce in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.                          Prepare the pineapple: Dust the pineapple slices with confectioners' sugar and place on a baking sheet. Bake until softened and lightly browned at the edges, about 30 minutes. Let cool.                          Make the chantilly cream: Whip the cream, confectioners' sugar and vanilla in a bowl with a mixer until fluffy and stiff peaks form. Chill.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.Heat beans in a medium sauce pot.

olive oil. Mix with a spoon, then let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add in 2 1/2 cups flour and salt, stirring with a spoon until the dough comes together but it still sticky. Using your hands, form the dough into a ball and work in the additional 1/2 cup flour, kneading it on a floured surface for a few minutes. Rub the same bowl with olive oil then place the dough inside, turning to coat. Cover with a towel and place in a warm place to rise for about 1 1/2 hours.After the dough has risen, punch it down and place it back on the floured surface. Sometimes I work in a few more sprinkles of flour if the dough is sticky. This amount of dough yielded 2 pizza crusts for my 12-inch cast iron skillet. If you're using an 8-inch, you may get 3 doughs, but you also may just want to stick with 2 thicker doughs. Divide the dough evenly in half (or thirds). Place one dough on a well-floured pizza peel and roll into a round about the size of your skillet.pizza + the skillet methodHeat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Season the beef with the salt, pepper and onion powder, then add to the skillet and cook until browned, using a wooden spoon to bread the beef into small crumbles, about 5 to 6 minutes. Drain any liquid from the skillet. Combine the ketchup and mustard in a small bowl and mix until combined. Note that this sauce makes enough for two pizzas, so use half on each. Remember, the dough MUST be on a well-floured pizza peel (or surface) so you can simply slide the entire thing into the skillet. Spread half of the sauce onto the dough and cover it with a sprinkling of cheddar. Add half of the beef on top, then add another handful of cheese and the bacon. The bacon should only be slightly cooked so it doesn't burn in the oven. Place an oven rack directly under your broiler and preheat your broiler to the highest setting. Additionally, place your cast iron skillet on the stovetop burner, turning the heat on high. You want to heat the skillet for 10 minutes. If it begins to smoke a lot, you can reduce the heat a bit. But you want it HOT.Place a potholder or thick towel on the handle of the skillet (it will be sooo hot). Carefully slide the pizza into the skillet, dough side down. Don't worry if a few toppings or pieces of cheese slice onto the surface - it will be totally fine. After about 30 seconds, turn off the burner, grab the skillet and pop it in the oven, right under the broiler. Broil for 1 minute, then using the potholder, grab the handle and rotate 180 degrees, broiling for only 1 more minute. Remove immediately and place on the stovetop. Let cool slightly for about 5 minutes, then use a large spatula to remove the pizza. Cover with the tomatoes (I like to sprinkle some salt and pepper on mine) and chopped lettuce, then slice.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"dough","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"In a large bowl, combine water, yeast, honey and olive oil.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"},{"id":19296,"name":"honey","image":"honey.png"},{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"yeast-granules.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Mix with a spoon, then let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":10,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Add in 2 1/2 cups flour and salt, stirring with a spoon until the dough comes together but it still sticky.

Mix to combine. Set aside for 5 minutes to gel up.\nTo a 2-cup or larger measuring cup, add the vinegar. Fill with almond milk to the 2-cup mark. Set aside for a couple of minutes to curdle a bit and form a buttermilk.\nIf your coconut oil isnt yet melted, you might want to set it in a small saucepan over low heat to melt while you prepare your dry ingredients.\nTo a large bowl, add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, pumpkin pie spice, and salt. Whisk to combine.\nTo the medium bowl with the flaxseed mix, add the almond milk mix, melted coconut oil, pumpkin, brown sugar, and vanilla. Whisk to combine.\nPour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients and mix with a whisk just until incorporated. Dont overmix  that can develop the gluten in the flour and lead to tough pancakes!\nLet the batter rest for 5 minutes. Theyll start to puff up and thatll give you fluffier pancakes! While the batter rests, preheat your non-stick griddle or a large frying pan over medium heat (or, if its an electric griddle, set to 325 degrees Fahrenheit).\nIf desired, melt a little vegan butter on the cooking surface (I like Earth Balance). If your surface is non-stick, this probably isnt necessary.
