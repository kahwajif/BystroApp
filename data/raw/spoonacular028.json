The most difficult part of this recipe is browning the noodles, and not burning them. It doesn't take long before the noodles are burnt, it seems to happen only a second or two after they are toasted, watch them carefully. Add toasted Ramen noodles to salad. Add slivered almonds to salad, use your hands and toss the cabbage, green onions, toasted ramen noodles, and almond slivers well.To make the dressing, use a medium sized bowl, or a shake bottle if you have it, add sugar, vinegar, dry ginger, dry mustard powder, Worechester sauce, and vegetable oil. Whisk thoroughly, it may seem the sugar won't dissolve, it will. If you wanted, I bet you could substitute the sugar with either equal or splenda. Once the sugar as completely dissovled pour over slaw, and mix well.I have taken Asian Crunchy Slaw to a couple of pot lucks recently with hopes that I would have a little extra to take home, and this didn't happen.

Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon.

Traditional techniques, including native yeasts, extended maceration, aging in French oak barrels and bottling without filtration, enhanced the wine's complexity. This wine is delicious with many entrees and cheeses. One of our favorite food pairings is roast turkey with a wild mushroom and walnut stuffing. Roast leg of lamb, rubbed with fragrant herbs and spices, or grilled pork loin also marry perfectly with the wine's luscious flavors.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438573-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.7473684210526317,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Frobert-mondavi-napa-merlot-1999%2F51817"}]},"instructions":"Place the meat in the pressure cooker and leave the lid off.

Whisk the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl; beat in the flour. Remove the vanilla bean and whisk the milk into the egg mixture. Pour back into the saucepan and whisk over medium heat until the cream is thick, about 8 minutes. Transfer the custard to a bowl; lay plastic wrap on the surface and cool in the refrigerator for about 3 hours. Transfer to a large pastry bag fitted with a wide round tip.                          Prepare the millefoglie: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cut the puff pastry into eighteen 3-inch rounds using a cookie cutter or a paring knife. Place the rounds on parchment paper-lined baking sheets, prick with a fork and bake until golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside to cool; leave the oven on.                          Make the maraschino sauce: Combine the black cherries, pineapple juice and maraschino cherry juice in a small saucepan. Bring the liquid to a simmer over medium heat and cook until the cherries are softened, about 5 minutes. Carefully transfer the mixture to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Strain the puree and set aside to cool. Store any extra sauce in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.                          Prepare the pineapple: Dust the pineapple slices with confectioners' sugar and place on a baking sheet. Bake until softened and lightly browned at the edges, about 30 minutes. Let cool.                          Make the chantilly cream: Whip the cream, confectioners' sugar and vanilla in a bowl with a mixer until fluffy and stiff peaks form. Chill.                          To assemble, place a pastry round on each of 6 serving plates. Pipe the custard over it and top with a slice of caramelized pineapple, followed by a pastry round and chantilly cream.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.Heat beans in a medium sauce pot.

olive oil. Mix with a spoon, then let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add in 2 1/2 cups flour and salt, stirring with a spoon until the dough comes together but it still sticky. Using your hands, form the dough into a ball and work in the additional 1/2 cup flour, kneading it on a floured surface for a few minutes. Rub the same bowl with olive oil then place the dough inside, turning to coat. Cover with a towel and place in a warm place to rise for about 1 1/2 hours.After the dough has risen, punch it down and place it back on the floured surface. Sometimes I work in a few more sprinkles of flour if the dough is sticky. This amount of dough yielded 2 pizza crusts for my 12-inch cast iron skillet. If you're using an 8-inch, you may get 3 doughs, but you also may just want to stick with 2 thicker doughs. Divide the dough evenly in half (or thirds). Place one dough on a well-floured pizza peel and roll into a round about the size of your skillet.pizza + the skillet methodHeat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Season the beef with the salt, pepper and onion powder, then add to the skillet and cook until browned, using a wooden spoon to bread the beef into small crumbles, about 5 to 6 minutes. Drain any liquid from the skillet. Combine the ketchup and mustard in a small bowl and mix until combined. Note that this sauce makes enough for two pizzas, so use half on each. Remember, the dough MUST be on a well-floured pizza peel (or surface) so you can simply slide the entire thing into the skillet. Spread half of the sauce onto the dough and cover it with a sprinkling of cheddar. Add half of the beef on top, then add another handful of cheese and the bacon. The bacon should only be slightly cooked so it doesn't burn in the oven. Place an oven rack directly under your broiler and preheat your broiler to the highest setting. Additionally, place your cast iron skillet on the stovetop burner, turning the heat on high. You want to heat the skillet for 10 minutes. If it begins to smoke a lot, you can reduce the heat a bit. But you want it HOT.Place a potholder or thick towel on the handle of the skillet (it will be sooo hot). Carefully slide the pizza into the skillet, dough side down. Don't worry if a few toppings or pieces of cheese slice onto the surface - it will be totally fine. After about 30 seconds, turn off the burner, grab the skillet and pop it in the oven, right under the broiler. Broil for 1 minute, then using the potholder, grab the handle and rotate 180 degrees, broiling for only 1 more minute. Remove immediately and place on the stovetop. Let cool slightly for about 5 minutes, then use a large spatula to remove the pizza.

translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir mushrooms, salt, and black pepper into shallots. Turn heat to medium-high and cook, stirring often, until mushrooms are golden brown, about 10 minutes.                            Pour white wine over mushroom mixture, dissolving any browned bits of food on bottom of skillet into wine; bring to a simmer. Gently place scallops into wine and poach in the mushroom mixture until barely firm, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer scallops to a bowl. Strain mushroom mixture into another bowl, reserving mushrooms and cooking liquid separately. Return strained liquid to skillet, pour in any accumulated juices from scallops, and stir in cream. Bring to a boil and cook until cream sauce is reduced by about half, about 10 minutes. Stir often. Turn off heat and let mixture cool for 1 minute.                            Quickly whisk egg yolk into cream sauce until combined. Transfer skillet to a work surface (such as a heatproof countertop or cutting board) and stir cayenne pepper, 2 teaspoons tarragon, and lemon zest into sauce.                            Divide mushroom mixture into scallop shells, spreading mushrooms out to cover bottoms of shells; place about 3 scallops onto each portion. Spoon cream sauce over scallops to coat; let sauce drizzle down into mushrooms. Sprinkle lightly with Gruyere cheese and paprika or cayenne.                            Turn oven's broiler to high.

Cut the remaining pieces to fit.Spread the remaining filling over top of the ladyfingers.For the topping:Put your mixing bowl and wire whisk in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes until it is completely cold. Beat the heavy cream on medium-high speed for several minutes until it starts to thicken. Add the powdered sugar and cocoa powder and continue beating until stiff peaks form.

Add the mustard seeds and fry for about ten seconds, or until they begin to splutter.Add the onion and ginger, and saute for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the peas, coriander, cumin, chili powder, garam masala and salt. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add the potatoes and cilantro, stir to combine, and cook for another 2 minutes. Add a few splashes of water (this may be more or less than 1/4 cup) until the mashed potatoes are slightly moist. Taste the mixture and adjust the seasoning as necessary, then remove from heat.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.Unroll the phyllo pastry dough, cover with plastic wrap and a damp lightweight towel. Peel off one sheet and keep the remaining dough covered so that it doesn't dry out. Lay the pastry sheet flat on a clean surface, and brush lightly with melted butter. Fold in one third of the pastry lengthwise towards the middle. Brush again with the butter and fold in the other side to make a long triple-layered strip.Place one rounded teaspoon of the filling mixture at one end of the strip. Take the right corner and fold diagonally to the left, enclosing the filling and forming a triangle. Fold again along the upper crease of the triangle. Keep folding in this way making triangles upon triangles until you reach the end of the strip. Brush a little butter on the dough to seal the samosa, and also brush the outer surface so that the outside is lightly coated in butter. Place the triangle onto a baking sheet and cover with another damp towel while you make the rest of the samosas. Bake in the center of the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until golden and crisp, turning halfway through the cooking time. Serve warm, garnished with extra chopped fresh cilantro if desired.Spoon about 1 rounded teaspoon of the filling into each mini phyllo cup. You can either serve these immediately, or pop them in a 400-degree oven for a few minutes to warm them up if need be. Serve garnished with extra chopped fresh cilantro if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the mustard seeds and fry for about ten seconds, or until they begin to splutter.","ingredients":[{"id":2024,"name":"mustard seeds","image":"mustard-seeds.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Add the onion and ginger, and saute for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.","ingredients":[{"id":11216,"name":"ginger","image":"ginger.png"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Add the peas, coriander, cumin, chili powder, garam masala and salt.
