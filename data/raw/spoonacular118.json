Mix well to combine. Add in cheese, panko, flour, salt and pepper, tossing again to mix. Stir in eggs and buffalo wing sauce until the mixture is moistened, then using your hands, form patties by pressing the quinoa together. I literally squeeze it together into my hands and form a patty, smoothing out the sides. Set the patties on a cutting board.Heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat and add olive oil.

Set aside.                          Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add the beans, and cook until they are bright green and crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Strain, and set aside to cool.                          Meanwhile, pulse the tomatoes, chopped shallots, ginger, 1 tablespoon of the oil, sugar, curry, cayenne and 1 teaspoon salt in a food processor until it becomes a puree.                          Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the sliced shallots, and cook, stirring frequently, until a deep golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato puree, and cook, stirring and scraping up the bottom frequently, until the paste is thick, dry and a few shades darker, 15 to 20 minutes. Add water, a tablespoon at a time, if the paste sticks to the bottom of the pot. (Be sure to scrape the side of the pot down, as some cooked paste may cling to it, and you want to make sure all the paste makes it into the sauce there's flavor in there!)                          Add 2 cups of water and the coconut milk to the pot, and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the eggplant, and simmer until soft, about 6 minutes. Add the peppers, and cook until soft, about 6 minutes. (The sauce should be a bit looser than marinara; continue to gently simmer if necessary.) Add the shrimp and green beans, and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are pink and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in most of the basil and cilantro, and season with salt.                          Transfer the curry to a serving bowl. Top with the lychees and the remaining basil and cilantro.

Heat the rapeseed oil in a large, preferably non-stick, saut or deep frying pan. Stir in the onions and fry over a medium heat for about 20 mins. Stir only occasionally so they can cook fairly undisturbed and caramelise underneath. When done, they should be well caramelised and sticky.\nMeanwhile, prepare the base. Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5 and put in a baking sheet. Put the flour and butter in a bowl with a pinch of salt and rub with your fingers until it resembles rough crumbs. Mix the yogurt and milk, pour it into the flour mixture and work together briefly with a knife until the dough just comes together. Remove from the bowl and gently press together to form a ball.

Allow to cool down for several minutes.  You may add the egg & salt to help cool it down, but whisk that egg so fast before it has a chance to cook/scramble.  You may also add 1 cup of the 4-5 cups of flour to help speed this process along.Meanwhile, dissolve 1 Tbsp yeast with 1 1/2 tsp sugar in 1 cup of warm water.

Once the dough is smoothed out, make it into a ball & let it rest in a lightly greased bowl, covered with plastic wrap or a towel.Once the dough has doubled in size, empty the dough onto a floured surface, divide it in half & roll into two circles.

Increase mixer speed to medium and beat until meringue turns foamy and white and starts to resemble well lathered shampoo, about 2 minutes. Increase mixer to high and beat until meringue holds glossy stiff peaks, about another 2-3 minutes. Turn off mixer.Process almond meal and powdered sugar in a food processor and then push it through a fine mesh sieve to sift.Add dry ingredients to meringue. Using a sturdy spatula fold and smash dry mixture into meringue against the bowl for about 20-25 folds. Don’t worry about being gentle the idea is to knock the air out of it. The batter should hold its shape when spooned on itself and start to slowly flatten out after about 15-20 seconds. Start checking the batter after 20 folds for readiness. Transfer batter to pastry bag and let rest for 20 minutes before piping.Place master copy of drawn circles on a bake sheet and then place a sheet of parchment on top. Fill a pastry bag with batter and pipe until batter reaches edge of circle. Remove master copy from underneath piped layer and place on second bake sheet and pipe remaining batter (remove master copy and save for future use).Take hold of each pan and give it quick hard tap against the counter, turn the pan 90 degrees and give it another quick hard tap. This will deflate any bubbles and prevent cracked shells.Bake for about 12-15 minutes. Remove from oven and transfer to a cooling rack. Leave shells to cool completely on pan.

Use the fork to lift the ball out of the chocolate and tap the fork on the rim of the bowl to allow excess chocolate to drip back into the pan, and then draw the underside of the fork over the rim of the pan to remove any drips of chocolate. Gently place the chocolate coated ball on the prepared baking pan, pushing the ball off the fork with another fork. Let balls sit until the chocolate is dry and firm. Tip: refrigerate chocolate coated balls about 30 minutes for the chocolate to become firm. However, if the chocolate has been tempered the balls do not need to be refrigerated as the chocolate should set quickly.In top of a double boiler over hot water, melt dark chocolate.Using a small spoon, place a small amount of dark chocolate onto the top of each milk chocolate coated ball.

Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti.

Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Cook the orzo in salted water, per instructions.

Add chicken, one piece at a time, and toss to coat; shake off excess. In a 6-qt. stockpot, heat oil over medium-high heat. Brown chicken in batches on all sides; remove from pan.

Gradually add stock, stirring constantly. Stir in wine, sugar, bay leaves and peppercorns. Return chicken to pan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, 20-25 minutes or until chicken juices run clear.

Remove chicken from stockpot; cool slightly. Discard bay leaves and skim fat from soup. Remove skin and bones from chicken and discard. Using two forks, coarsely shred meat into 1- to 1-1/2-in. pieces; return to soup. Cook, covered, on high until mixture reaches a simmer.                                                                                                                                                       Drop dumplings on top of simmering soup, a few at a time. Reduce heat to low; cook, covered, 15-18 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center of dumplings comes out clean (do not lift cover while simmering). Gently stir in cream, parsley and thyme.

Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Loveblock Pinot Gris with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match.

Set a wire rack over a baking sheet.                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Season the fish fillets on both sides with salt and pepper. Dredge one fillet in flour, lift it out, knock off excess flour, and place fillet in egg wash, making sure entire fillet is coated. Remove fillet from egg wash, letting excess drip off; place in crumbs. Gently press crumbs onto fish on both sides, coating it completely. Transfer breaded fillet to cooling rack; repeat process with remaining fillets.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Place a well-seasoned 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat; heat for 5 minutes. Add the oil and butter to skillet. Sprinkle a few crumbs into pan to test temperature—they should sizzle when they hit the fat. Lower fish fillets into hot fat, which should come halfway up sides of fish. As soon as crumbs begin to darken, reduce heat a bit. The key is even cooking, so that when you turn the fillets, they are a perfect golden brown. This will take about 3 to 4 minutes a side; the thicker the fish, the more slowly you should cook it—turn the heat down a bit more if necessary. Turn the fillets; cook 3 to 4 minutes more, until golden brown. Add a little more oil and butter to pan if it appears dry.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            Using a slotted spatula, transfer fish to individual plates or a platter.

bowl. Add buttermilk and whisk until the salt is completely dissolved and the spices are dispersed in the liquid.Cut chicken lengthwise into about 1-inch-wide strips. Add to the marinade and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. (Do not marinate any longer and dont refrigerate, or the chicken will be too salty.)Combine breadcrumbs, the remaining 1 teaspoon paprika and 1/2 teaspoon each onion powder and garlic powder in a large shallow dish (a 9-by-13-inch baking dish works well). Add 2 tablespoons oil and toss well to coat. Whisk egg whites and mustard in a second large shallow dish. Season both mixtures with pepper.Preheat oven to 350F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil, then set a large wire rack on it. Coat the rack with cooking spray.Remove the chicken from the marinade, shaking off any excess, and thread onto six 12-inch bamboo skewers, dividing evenly. Dip the chicken into the egg mixture, coating both sides. Place in the breadcrumb mixture one at a time, sprinkle with crumbs to cover and press so the coating adheres to both sides. Gently shake off any excess crumbs and place the skewers on the prepared rack.Bake the chicken, turning halfway through, until golden brown and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes.Meanwhile, prepare the dipping sauce: Place onion in a food processor fitted with a metal blade and process until smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed. Add vinegar, honey, mustard, salt and pepper; process until smooth. With the motor running, add oil through the feed tube in a slow, steady stream until the mixture is thick and well combined. Taste and adjust seasoning with more honey, salt and/or pepper, if desired.Serve the chicken with the dipping sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"To make chicken","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine kosher salt, 1 teaspoon paprika and 1/2 teaspoon each onion powder and garlic powder in a large bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":1022020,"name":"garlic powder","image":"garlic-powder.png"},{"id":2026,"name":"onion powder","image":"onion-powder.jpg"},{"id":1082047,"name":"kosher salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":2028,"name":"paprika","image":"paprika.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add buttermilk and whisk until the salt is completely dissolved and the spices are dispersed in the liquid.","ingredients":[{"id":1230,"name":"buttermilk","image":"buttermilk.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Cut chicken lengthwise into about 1-inch-wide strips.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Add to the marinade and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.

medium sauté pan and set over medium-high heat. When the garlic begins to sizzle (after about 40 seconds), add the onion, chile, turmeric, and ½ teaspoon of salt and sauté until the vegetables become limp and translucent, about 5 minutes.Transfer the sautéed vegetables to a blender and add the evaporated milk, goat cheese, and egg. Puree until smooth. Taste for seasoning and add more salt if necessary. The sauce should have the consistency of creamy salad dressing. If you need to thin it out, add a bit more evaporated milk. Set aside. Prepare foil packets of potatoesCut a piece of foil about 14 inches in length and place ¼ of the potatoes in its center. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of olive oil onto the potatoes and toss gently to coat well. Season with salt and pepper.Create a square packet by bringing the long sides of the foil up toward the center and folding the edges over a couple of times to create a seal. Bring the ends up towards the center and seal by crimping the foil shut. Repeat the process three times to end up with a total of four packets. Roast the potatoesHeat your grill to high (550°F) and close the lid. Wait at least 15 minutes before lowering the heat to medium-high (450°F) and continuing.Place the potato packets on the grill shelf and close the lid. Allow the potatoes to roast for 40 minutes, or until tender. I test this by skewering the tip of a thin knife through the foil and into a potato. If I don’t meet resistance, the potatoes are ready. If you do not have a grill shelf, lower the heat to medium and place the packets directly on the grates. Char the potatoesIncrease the grill heat to high (550°F). Place the packets directly on the grates, close the lid, and allow to cook for 15 minutes to char the bottom of the potatoes. Remove the packets from the grill and set aside to cool. ServeOpen the packets, being careful not to burn yourself with the steam, and transfer the potatoes to a serving bowl. You may need to peel off some of the potatoes that have become stuck and charred to the foil. (If the potatoes have not developed a charred crust, close the foil packet and return to the grill until a crust develops.)

Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":449340,"title":"St. Innocent Momtazi Hill Pinot Noir ( half-bottle)","description":"This is a complex wine that reflects the heat of the afternoon sun, the cool, windy evenings, and the rustic soils of the McMinnville hills while retaining the dark beauty of its intense, ripe fruit. It is aromatically complex with layers of blue and black fruit, Indian spices, coffee hints, and pepper. In the mouth the blue/black fruit flavors and eastern spice notes are layered with a \"sauvage\" sense of wildness. Texturally layered, its flavors vary in intensity and quality over your tongue and palate. Ample ripe tannins balance with its acidity.","price":"$19.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/449340-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":8,"score":0.76,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fst-innocent-momtazi-hill-pinot-noir-375ml-half-bottle-2014%2F167614"}]},"instructions":"Add thinly sliced apples to a small bowl with lemon juice and toss to coat.On serving tray spread out apple slices in thin layer.Melt almond butter in microwave until runny, about 1 minute.
