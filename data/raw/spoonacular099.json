In a medium saucepan (about 2- or 3-quart), combine the vanilla bean seeds, scraped vanilla bean pods, heavy cream, and milk. Bring the mixture just to a simmer. Remove the pot from the heat, cover and let the mixture sit for 10-15 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean pods.In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar together until well combined. Slowly ladle the hot cream mixture into the egg mixture while whisking constantly and quickly so the eggs don't cook and form hard little bits. Adding it slowly tempers the eggs so they don't cook too quickly.Pour the mixture into 6 ramekins (about 7- to 8-ounce). If you are using flatter ramekins (4- to 5-ounce), you'll probably get about 8 ramekins-full out of this recipe.Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Warm about 3-4 quarts hot water (depends on how big your roasting pan is) until hot but not boiling.Place a kitchen towel in the bottom of a large roasting pan. Place the filled ramekins on top of the towel and set the roasting pan on an oven rack in the center of the oven. Carefully pour the hot water into the roasting pan, avoiding splashing any water into the ramekins. Bake the creme brulee for 40-45 minutes until set but still slightly jiggly in the center (if the edges are still jiggling, bake it a few minutes longer). Using a large, flat spatula, immediately and carefully remove the ramekins from the hot water. Let them cool completely and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until completely cold, 6 hours or up to 3 days. About 30 minutes before serving, remove the ramekins from the refrigerator, blot the tops dry with a paper towel. Lightly sprinkle about 2 teaspoons or so of granulated sugar evenly across the top of the creme brulee (lifting the ramekin and tipping it from side to side will help the sugar spread evenly). Using a kitchen torch, quickly melt the sugar until it forms a golden, crispy top. Refrigerate until ready to serve (no longer than 30 minutes once the top is caramelized or it can turn a bit mushy). The creme brulee inevitably warms up a bit after the top gets browned so refrigerating for at least 10 minutes will allow it to chill slightly again.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Gently slice through the skin of the vanilla bean and with the flat edge of the knife, scrape out the seeds (see how-to video below).

In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat butter and shortening together until smooth. Add sugar and beat 1 to 2 minutes or until fluffy. Beat in molasses. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then add egg and vanilla and mix until smooth. Add half of dry ingredients and mix on low speed until just incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add remaining dry ingredients in two additions until no streaks of flour remain. The dough should be thick and just slightly sticky. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; chill for at least 1 hour or overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Roll dough into 1 inch balls (or use a small cookie scoop which is the perfect size). Roll into a smooth ball, then roll in granulated sugar. Arrange on prepared baking sheet, leaving 2 inches of space between balls. Gently press an indentation into each cookie using your thumb or the back of a rounded 1/4 teaspoon (something like a melon baller, or even a marble would also work well). Don't press all the way, you want the indentation about half the depth of the cookie without it cracking too much around the edges. Bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until puffed and bottoms are just barely starting to darken; bake them on the lower side of the time range if you will be shipping your cookies or if you prefer softer cookies overall. Re-press the puffed indentations while the cookies are still warm, then let cool for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough. To make filling, gently melt chocolate together with butter and corn syrup in a saucepan over the lowest heat setting possible, or in the microwave on 50% power in 30 second intervals. When chocolate is melted and smooth, transfer to a piping bag fitted with a 1/2-inch-round tip, then pipe into thumbprints. You can also spoon the chocolate into the thumbprints, but I found the piping bag way more efficient. Let sit at room temperature for about 1 hour or refrigerate briefly until chocolate is set.

Line large rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Combine 1/2 cup milk powder, flour, sugar, cornstarch, and coarse salt in medium bowl; toss to mix evenly. Add butter and stir until clusters form. Spread mixture evenly on prepared sheet. Bake until crumbs are dry and crumbly but still pale, about 20 minutes.  Cool completely.  Crumble any large clusters, and transfer all of the crumbs to a bowl.  Add the additional 1/4 cup milk powder and toss.  Pour the white chocolate over the crumbs and toss.  Continue to toss every 5 minutes until the white chocolate hardens and the clusters are no longer sticky.  to make the cookies:Mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl and set aside.In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter, sugars and glucose on high for 2-3 minutes.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl.  Add the eggs and beat for an additional 7-8 minutes until fluffy and doubled in size.  See my confetti cookie post for details on this process.  Reduce the speed to low and add the dry ingredients and mix just until the cookie dough comes together, no longer than 1 minute.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl.  While on low speed, add the milk crumbs and the dried blueberries and mix for 30 seconds.Using a 2 3/4-ounce ice cream scoop (or 1/3-cup measuring cup), portion the dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet pan.  Pat the tops of the cookies down, cover tighly with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour, or up to 1 week.  Do not bake your cookies from room temperature!Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line two large cookie sheets with parchment paper or Silpat liners. Arrange the chilled dough about 4 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.  Bake for 18 minutes.  The cookies will puff, crackle and spread.  After 18 minutes, they should be just browned on the edges and still bright in the centers.  Cool the cookies completely on the cookie sheets before transferring to an airtight container.Cassie's Notes:I found dried blueberries at Trader Joe's near the dried cranberries, etc.  Most grocery stores should have them or you can order them from Amazon.com; don't get freeze-dried berries, just the dried ones.Or you could just swap the blueberries for any of your favorite dried fruit.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"to make the milk crumb:Preheat oven to 250°F.

the artichokes. Use kitchen scissors to snip off the tips of the leaves, and then cut off the stem and about 1/2 inch of the top with a sharp knife. Rinse well under cold water. Place the artichokes in a large pot filled with two inches water. Add the lemon slice and bay leaf. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer and cover, continuing to boil until tender, 30-40 minutes. Remove from water and set aside to cool. While the artichokes are steaming, make the rosemary olive oil and roast the garlic. To make the rosemary olive oil, pour the oil into a small saucepan set over medium heat. Add the rosemary sprigs. Bring just to a boil, then remove from heat. Let sit for 5 minutes. Remove the rosemary and discard it. To roasted the garlic cloves, preheat the oven to 375º F. Place the unpeeled cloves in a shallow baking pan or pie dish and drizzle with 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Toss to coat and cover pan with foil. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until garlic is soft. Remove from oven and let cool enough to handle.Make the dipping sauce. Squeeze the roasted garlic into the bowl of a food processor and discard the garlic skins. Add 1/2 cup rosemary olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, and salt. Blend until pureed, about 30 seconds. Pour into a small serving bowl and set aside.

The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8073684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Ffonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998%2F12434"}]},"instructions":"Warm the chicken broth and rosemary in a saucepan over medium heat; set aside.

Add a splash or soy sauce and a sprinkle of sugar and black pepper. Mix well. Do not stress too much over whether the amount of soy sauce and sugar is enough at this point. Your just creating the first layer of flavors and everything can be adjusted during the braising process.Heat the peanut oil in a thick bottomed pan. Ideally, the pan should be wide enough to accommodate all the pork pieces in a single layer. When the oil is hot, add the pork cubes and brown lightly on all sides. You can skip this step but browning the meat does give the pork better texture.Pour in two to three generous splashes of cooking wine, cook until most of the liquid has evaporated.Pour in about a quarter cup of soy sauce (you can add more later, of needed) and a splash of black vinegar. Add the hoisin sauce, chilis, ginger, garlic, shallots and start anise. Pour in about a cup of broth (water will do but broth will make a much flavorful sauce), cover tightly then simmer until the pork is done and only a few tablespoonfuls of the sauce remains. Depending on the quality of the pork and how tender you like your meat, this can take anywhere from an hour to two hours.Check the meat every 20 minutes or so. If it looks like it’ll need more liquid, add more broth (or water), no more than half a cup at a time. Check the seasonings as well. Add more soy sauce (or salt if you don’t want the dish to turn too dark), black vinegar and sugar, as needed.When the pork is almost ready, fish out the ginger, garlic, shallots and start anise.

With a sharp knife, slice off skin by cutting down from center around outside skin, cutting right down to the flesh.With that same sharp knife, cut out the wedges by running the knife around each segment and lifting them out. When done, all that should be left are the membranes connected to the core. I'm not recommending that you hold the orange in your hand and cut down into each segment towards your hand, but it is easier and if you are skilled with a knife, you can do that but for safety, place the orange on your board and cut down into each segment that way.Four hours before service or overnight, make dressing by straining the juice of one orange through a strainer which should yield  cup of pulp free juice.Add mustard, honey, cilantro and oil and using an immersion blender or a blender or a food processor, blend until a creamy dressing has formed, about 30 seconds.Cube the cheese into small  inch cubes and combine with the dressing. Let sit refrigerated to marinate for at least four hours or overnight.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.Note: Because the red beets bleed into other foods, keep the two types of beets separated until ready for service.Peel beets and cut into pieces a little larger than bite sized. Keep two beet types separate. Place each beet type in its own bowl.In a small bowl mix the  cup of orange juice, the  cup of oil, salt and pepper. Pour half the mixture over each beet.Using two small sheet trays place each beet with the cooking liquid on their own pans and roast for 45 minutes, flipping once or twice through roasting.Prepare two small storage containers with lids to marinate the beets in.Mix the half cup of the strained Cara Cara juice with the two tablespoons of sugar and pour half into each container.As soon as the beets come out of the oven, place each into their own containers, cover and refrigerate four hours or overnight.While beets are roasting, prepare candied cashews (Recipe here).Once ready for service, place a strainer over a bowl and pour out the cheese with the dressing. Use a spoon and gently toss the cheese so that the dressing drains to the waiting bowl.Drain each beet the same way except discard beet liquid.Line a platter or individual plates with the torn lettuce.Then arrange in any order you wish, red beets, gold beets and orange segments.
