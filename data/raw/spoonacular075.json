The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Attems Ramato Pinot Grigio.

Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":5,"score":0.8175000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fattems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014%2F160114"}]},"instructions":"Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.Place flour in a shallow bowl.

Line an 8-by-8-inch baking pan with aluminum foil leaving overhang on the sides, spray with cooking spray; set aside. In a large, microwave-safe bowl, add the butter and heat on high power to melt, about 1 minute. Allow butter to cool momentarily so you don't scramble the eggs. Add the eggs, sugars, optional coffee, vanilla, and whisk to combine. Add the cocoa powder, optional espresso granules, optional salt, and whisk to combine. If your cocoa powder is lumpy, it could take a couple minutes of vigorous whisking. Add the flour and stir until just combined, don't overmix. Turn batter out into prepared pan, smoothing it lightly with a spatula or knife. Batter is very thick and fudgy so take your time to work it into the corners of the pan. Add the cherry jam over the brownie batter in 1 tablespoon-sized blobs. Stirring it first in the jar to break it up will make dolloping it out easier. Using a knife, gently swirl the jam through the batter in a zig-zag pattern. Don't get carried away and over-swirl because it will sink to the bottom of the pan while baking. Evenly sprinkle chocolate chunks over the pan. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until done; don't overbake (I baked for 21 minutes in my very hot-running Caribbean oven). Because ovens, ingredients (how much moisture is in the jam used), and climates vary, use your judgment when your brownies are done; watch your brownies, not the number on the clock. A toothpick inserted in the center should come out mostly clean, but will likely have a few moist crumbs, but no batter. The jam doesn't fully set up, and the chocolate chunks will be melty, so make sure to examine the brownie portion, not the jam or chocolate chunks portion, when glancing at your toothpick. Allow brownies to rest for at least 1 hour, or overnight, before lifting out with foil overhang and slicing. Letting them cool properly gives the jam and chocolate chunks a chance to firm up and solidify. Brownies will keep airtight at room temperature or refrigerator for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 6 months. I prefer to store rich brownies like these in the fridge and serve them slightly chilled.

overhang on two sides. Lightly coat the foil and a wooden spoon with cooking spray.                          Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the marshmallows, honey, vanilla and a pinch of salt, and stir with the prepared wooden spoon until the marshmallows have completely melted, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the rice cereal, and stir until the mixture is fully combined. Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan, and press into an even layer. Let sit at room temperature until firm, about 20 minutes.                          For the cheesecake layer: Meanwhile, combine the gelatin with 2 tablespoons water in a small microwave-safe bowl, and set aside to soften, about 5 minutes.                          Beat the cream cheese on medium-high speed in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a hand mixer) until completely smooth, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the sour cream, sugar, lemon juice, vanilla and a pinch of salt, and beat on medium high speed until incorporated and smooth, about 1 minute.                          Microwave the gelatin until melted, stirring as needed, about 30 seconds. Add the gelatin to the cream cheese mixture, and beat on medium high speed to combine, about 30 seconds.                          To assemble: Pour the cream cheese-gelatin mixture over the cooled crispy layer, and spread out evenly. Wrap the pan loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until the cheesecake layer is set, about 2 hours. (The bars can be assembled and refrigerated overnight.)

Wrap the dough in waxed paper and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes.2. Let the dough rest at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Butter and lightly flour an 11-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.3. Roll out the pastry dough on a floured work surface to a circle slightly larger than the tart pan. Transfer the dough to the pan, allowing the excess to hang over the edges of the pan. Gently press the dough into the pan. Roll a rolling pin over the top, using the edge of the pan as a cutting surface, and let the excess pastry fall away. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. 4. Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC).5. Prick the pastry all over with the tines of a fork, line it with parchment paper, and fill with baking weights. Bake for 15 minutes, then remove the parchment and weights and bake for 10 to 15 minutes more, until golden. Let cool to room temperature before filling.Make the pear and almond filling6. Decrease the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C).7. In a bowl, combine the butter and sugar and beat with a handheld or stand mixer until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the almonds, flour, and vanilla seeds or extract and mix just until combined. Spoon the filling into the partially baked pastry shell and smooth the surface. 8. Arrange the pear slices on top of the almond mixture. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until puffed and golden.

(If that doesn't happen, your yeast is probably too old; start again with a freshly purchased packet.)In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment (see below about making the dough entirely by hand), combine by hand the flour, salt, cinnamon, and brown sugar. Add in the milk mixture and the eggs, and stir by hand again (I detach the dough hook and use that) to moisten most of the flour so it won't fly off everywhere when you turn the mixer on.Turn the mixer on and knead at low speed for 5 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic and no longer sticks to the sides of the bowl.Add in the butter.Knead for another 2 minutes, until the butter is fully incorporated. The dough will be quite sticky.(The kneading can also be done by hand. It's more of a workout, obviously, and the part when you have to work in the softened butter can be a bit messy. The key is to not lose hope -- the dough will eventually absorb the butter -- and take heart in the fact that you'll have the softest hands afterward.)Cover the bowl tightly with a kitchen towel and leave to rise at warm room temperature, away from drafts, until doubled in size. The exact time needed will vary depending on the temperature in your kitchen, but it should take about 2 hours.Fold the pearl sugar into the dough -- this will deflate it and that's okay -- so it's evenly distributed.Divide the dough into 15 pieces, each about 75 grams (2 2/3 ounces), and shape them (roughly) into balls.

Tie in about 5 spots using kitchen string; securing it. Make 4 to 6 gashes in the meat, about 1/4 inch deep. Place the roast in a shallow pan.To prepare marinade: Combine yogurt, 2/3 cup ginger, garlic, cinnamon sticks, peppercorns and salt in a blender. Puree, scraping down the sides as needed, to make a slightly gritty paste, speckled with spices.Pour the marinade over the lamb and massage it into the meat, making sure you get it into the gashes.

Clear out a spot in your refrigerator or freezer to accommodate baking sheet. In a shallow microwave-safe bowl, combine chocolate chips and shortening (the shortening helps the chocolate stay smooth when using it for dipping; it prevents that thick and gloppy, chocolate getting hard before you want it to phenomenon) and heat for 1 minute on high power to melt. Stir and heat in 10 to 15 second bursts until chocolate can be stirred very smooth. To the melted chocolate add 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract* and stir. If you prefer it mintier, add another 1/4 teaspoon. I used 3/4 teaspoon in total, but because all brands and taste preferences differ, taste your chocolate and add peppermint to taste. *Note: Mint extract is much, much more potent than vanilla extract; 1 teaspoon of mint extract has an extreme amount of potency compared with 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. You cannot un-do mint once added so be very, very careful to not over-do it and end up with a bottle of Listerine-tasting food. There are different kinds of mint extracts available and are labeled as “mint, “peppermint”, “spearmint” and more. For this recipe I used store-brand (Kroger/Ralph’s) “peppermint extract” sold in a small 1 ounce bottle. Select the version of “mint” you think sounds best as not all types are available in all areas.  Add 1 cracker to the chocolate, coat it, and remove it by lightly scooping it up from the underside with a fork, allowing excess chocolate to drain off through fork tines. Place cracker on parchment and repeat with all remaining crackers. If necessary, re-heat the chocolate in 10 to 15 second bursts if it starts getting too firm for smooth dipping. After all crackers have been dipped, place baking sheet in refrigerator. Although these will solidify at room temperature, the shortening in the chocolate lengthens the amount of time that will take; the fridge or freezer helps speed it up. Store extra Thin Mints in an airtight container in the refrigerator for many weeks. In the freezer, I estimate that these could be kept for 3 to 6 months successfully.
