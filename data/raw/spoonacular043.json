Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Steak. After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. One wine you could try is Robert Mondavi Napa Merlot. It has 4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 30 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":438573,"title":"Robert Mondavi Napa Merlot","description":"The wine's multi-dimensional flavors come from grapes grown in distinctly different terroirs of Napa Valley, including the Carneros, Stags Leap and Oakville districts. Traditional techniques, including native yeasts, extended maceration, aging in French oak barrels and bottling without filtration, enhanced the wine's complexity. This wine is delicious with many entrees and cheeses. One of our favorite food pairings is roast turkey with a wild mushroom and walnut stuffing. Roast leg of lamb, rubbed with fragrant herbs and spices, or grilled pork loin also marry perfectly with the wine's luscious flavors.","price":"$29.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/438573-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.7473684210526317,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Frobert-mondavi-napa-merlot-1999%2F51817"}]},"instructions":"Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.

Remove from the heat and leave aside.Melt the butter in a pot, add the finely chopped onion and sauté until soft and golden. Add the rice and toast, stirring often, until translucent.Add a ladleful of broth and stir the rice until absorbed.Keep adding ladlefuls of saffron broth, stirring vigorously and allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next. This will take about 20 minutes. When the rice will be creamy but al dente remove from the heat and mix in the Parmigiano reggiano. Add a good pinch of salt. Scoop the risotto in a large tray and let it cool down completely.In the meantime make the filling. Remove the woody ends of the asparagus, wash them and slice them thinly.Cook them in a pan with a few tablespoons of olive oil for about 10 minutes, until they are soft but still slightly crunchy. Add the crumbled hard-boiled eggs, season with salt and pepper and set them aside. When they are cold add the diced taleggio cheese.Now it's time to make the arancine. Shape the rice with wet hands in an orange size ball, open the rice and but inside a teaspoon of filling, then close them again.

Grill the chicken uncovered for 6 to 8 minutes total. Turn onto each side twice, rotating the breasts each time to get crisscross grill marks. The chicken is done when it is white throughout but still juicy. Grill the limes alongside the chicken, turning them from time to time so that they soften and develop a bit of char.

Working quickly pull the chicken into thin shreds and pile it on a platter. Surround with the limes, and set the bowl of sauce on the platter or alongside. Place the wrapped tortillas in a basket.

Add the masa harina and beat 2 minutes. Add the baking powder and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt; continue beating until incorporated, about 5 minutes. Add the hot broth and continue beating until the dough is soft and fluffy (it should pull away from the side of the bowl easily). Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let sit about 10 minutes.                          Place the corn husks in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer until softened, about 8 minutes. Drain.                          Make the filling: Roast the poblanos over the flame of a gas burner, turning, until charred, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let cool. Peel the poblanos with your fingers and discard the stems and seeds, then coarsely chop. Melt the butter in a medium saute pan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, corn and poblanos and cook 2 more minutes. Add the crema; when it starts bubbling, reduce the heat to low and stir in the cheese until melted. Season with salt and set aside to cool.                          Tear 4 corn husks into 1/2-inch-thick strips to use as ties; set aside. Assemble the tamales: Hold an open corn husk in one hand; spread about 2 tablespoons dough on the husk, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border on all sides. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the filling down the center, then fold in the long sides of the husk to cover the filling and fold up the narrow short end (leave the wide end open). Tie a strip of corn husk around the tamale to hold the folded flaps in place. Repeat to make 12 tamales.                          Place the tamales, open-side up, in a steamer basket set in a large pot. Add enough water to cover the bottom of the pot by several inches, but not enough to touch the tamales. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low; cover the pot with a kitchen towel and a lid and steam until firm, 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, adding more water to the pot if needed. The tamales should pull away from the husks without sticking; if they're still sticky, continue cooking. Let stand at least 10 minutes before serving.

sauce, 1/2 teaspoon cumin and red pepper flakes. Place the chicken breasts in a ziploc bag and pour the marinade over the chicken. Close the bag and refrigerate for at least an hour or up to overnight.Heat a grill to medium-high heat (an indoor grill pan or skillet could be used also). Grill the chicken until it is cooked through, about 5-7 minutes per side. Cool the chicken completely then cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Set aside.Place the eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring the water to a rolling boil. Cover and remove from the heat. Let the eggs sit for 13 minutes then rinse them under cold water until they are completely cooled. Peel and coarsely chop the eggs. Set aside.Cook the bacon over medium heat until it is crisp. Drain on paper towels. When cool, crumble and set aside.In a medium bowl, combine the yellow pepper, tomatoe, olives, and 1/2 of the sweet onion. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.In another bowl, combine the black beans, 1/4 cup cilantro and onion. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.In another bowl (dont worry, we are almost done with the excess of bowls), combine the avocado, 1/4 cup cilantro, juice of 2 limes, cayenne pepper and 1/2 teaspoon cumin. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.On a large platter (or large bowl), arrange the romaine lettuce. Arrange the chicken in a strip down the middle of the romaine. On either side, make piled strips of the eggs, bacon, yellow pepper mixture, black bean mixture and avocado mixture. Drizzle with dressing or serve it on the side. The easiest way to serve this on a platter is with a pair of tongs. If using a large bowl, gently toss to combine all the ingredients before serving.For the dressing, combine all the ingredients together in a blender. Process until smooth.

Add the coconut oil and once melted, add the beef in 2 or 3 batches. You don't want to crowd the beef and you only want to cook it for a few minutes so it stays tender.

Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Have ready a large ovenproof enameled cast-iron pot or other heavy pot that has a lid and is large enough to just barely contain the brisket snugly.2. Lightly dust the brisket with flour, then sprinkle it with pepper. Heat the oil in the pot over medium-high heat. Add the brisket to the pot and cook on both sides until crusty and browned areas appear on the surface here and there, 5 to 7 minutes per side.3. Transfer the brisket to a platter. Turn up the heat under the pot a bit, then add the onions and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon and scraping up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Cook until the onions have softened and developed a rich brown color but aren’t yet caramelized, 10 to 15 minutes.4. Turn off the heat and place the brisket on top of the onions. Pour any juices that accumulated on the platter over the brisket. Spread the tomato paste over the brisket as if you were icing a cake. Sprinkle the brisket with salt and pepper, then add the garlic and carrot to the pot. Cover the pot, transfer it to the oven, and let it cook, untouched, for 1 1/2 hours.5. Transfer the brisket to a cutting board. Using a very sharp knife, thinly slice the meat across the grain into approximately 1/8-inch-thick slices. Return the slices to the pot, overlapping them at an angle so that you can see a bit of the top edge of each slice. The end result should resemble the original unsliced brisket leaning slightly backward. If absolutely necessary, add 2 to 3 teaspoons of water to the pot.6. Cover the pot and return it to the oven. Lower the heat to 325°F (163°C) and cook until the brisket is fork-tender, about 2 hours more. Check once or twice during cooking to make sure that the liquid hasn’t bubbled away. If it has, add a few more teaspoons of water—but no more. Also, each time you check, spoon some of the liquid on top of the roast so that it drips down between the slices.7. It’s ready to serve right away with its juices, but, in fact, it’s even better the second day. (You can let the brisket cool, cover it loosely with foil, and refrigerate it overnight to serve the day after.

The wine was created differently from most Chardonnay you've had. We think we've succeeded in expressing the crisp, steely, and fruit-rich side that we love about some Old-World Chardonnays. What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"To make the tuna balls:Place the tuna, onions, mustard, lime juice, eggs, garlic powder, salt, pepper and the bread crumbs into a medium mixing bowl and stir to combine.Divide the mixture into balls and set aside on a parchment lined pan.

To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes.

Cut a circle from the top of the pumpkin at a 45-degree angle, the way you would cut open a pumpkin to make a jack-o’-lantern, and set aside.Scoop out the seeds and strings as best you can. Generously salt and pepper the inside of the pumpkin, pop the top back on it, place it on a rimmed baking dish (since the pumpkin may leak or weep a bit), and bake for 45 minutes.Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a sauté pan over medium heat. If the sausages are in their casings, remove the meat and discard the casings. Crumble the sausage meat into small chunks and cook until lightly browned. Remove the sausage from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside to cool. Discard the drippings, or save for gravy or what have you.Also while the pumpkin bakes, cook the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain through a colander and rinse with cool water to stop the cooking process.In a bowl, toss together the Fontina, Gruyère, sausage, pasta, scallions, and herbs.Once the pumpkin is done baking, take it out of the oven and fill it with the macaroni and cheese. Pour the cream over the filling. Place the top back on the pumpkin and bake for 1 hour, taking the top off for the last 15 minutes so the cheese on top of the filling can properly brown. If the top cream still seems a bit too wobbly and liquid, give it another 10 minutes in the oven. The cream may bubble over a bit, which is fine.If the pumpkin splits while baking, as occasionally happens, be thankful you set it in a rimmed baking dish and continue to bake as normal.Allow the pumpkin to rest for 10 minutes before serving. Be careful moving the dish, as the pumpkin may be fragile. You can serve this dish two ways: Cut it into sections and serve them, or just scoop out the insides with scrapings of the pumpkin flesh for each serving. Either way is just dandy. Salt and pepper to taste.Alternative cheeses: Fontina and Gruyère are widely available and are best used for this recipe, but feel free to try your favorite cheese. We particularly like Valley Ford’s Estero Gold or its Highway 1 Fontina, as well as Roth Käse’s MezzaLuna Fontina.

We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Heat mushroom soup, add pimento, green pepper, onion, and mayonnaise.

your rib-eye chops, making sure to cut as close to the bone as possible to conserve the meat. Cut the meat into 1-inch cubes and reserve the bones. If you've got time, crank your oven to 425°F, set the bones in a shallow baking sheet, and roast them until the edges start to caramelize -- about 20 minutes. If you don't have time, just set them aside raw for later in the recipe.Preheat oven to 225°F.Heat olive oil in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Add shallots, cooking until they are tender and just beginning to brown, about 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally to keep them from burning. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat.Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high flame and sear pork cubes on all sides. Remove pork from the Dutch oven and pour in white wine. Lower heat to medium-low and cook for 1 minute, scraping up all the good meaty bits on the bottom with a spatula.Pour cooked shallots and seared pork into the Dutch oven with the white wine, then add tomatoes, tomatillos, chicken stock, bay leaf, cilantro, oregano, salt, and pepper. Stir well and nestle the pork bones into the stew.Cover the Dutch oven and slide it into the oven. Cook for 2 to 3 hours, stirring well once every hour. The longer the stew cooks, the more tender the pork will be. If necessary, add a little water or stock here and there, in ¼ cup increments, to keep the stew from burning.Remove the stew from the oven and discard the bones. Set the Dutch oven on the stove over medium heat. Add cornstarch and cold water to a cup and stir until completely mixed. Pour cornstarch into stew and cook, stirring constantly, until the liquid in the stew has thickened up. This should take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes.Serve stew hot, topped with freshly chopped parsley.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Using a sharp paring knife, carefully remove the bones from your rib-eye chops, making sure to cut as close to the bone as possible to conserve the meat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404745,"name":"knife","image":"chefs-knife.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Cut the meat into 1-inch cubes and reserve the bones.

To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. One wine you could try is Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":432869,"title":"Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay","description":"The Napa Valley Reserve Chardonnay opens with toasty aromas of vanilla bean, baked pears and a hint of cantaloupe.

Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and let cool, then thinly slice.                          Meanwhile, put the green beans in a microwave-safe bowl and add a splash of water. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave until tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain and pat dry; set aside.                          Make the dressing: Whisk the yogurt, vinegar and olive oil in a medium bowl; season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Toss the romaine with 1 tablespoon of the dressing in a large bowl.                          Divide the romaine among bowls. Arrange the red onion, green beans, salmon, olives, potatoes, tomatoes and white beans on top. Drizzle with the remaining dressing. Season with salt and pepper.
