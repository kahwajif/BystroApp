Adjust ingredients for the box mix you have and use the liquid called for in the steps 2 and 3. 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and prepare a 9x13 inch cake pan.2. Measure out water into a measuring cup, then remove 4 tbsp and put it in a small bowl.3. Microwave the water in the small bowl until warm, then add 2 tbsp espresso powder. Stir until dissolved. 4. Combine ingredients, including espresso, according to box instructions and bake in 9x13 pan. 5. Once cake comes out of the oven, poke holes in the top of the cake. I used a knife sharpener. 6. Place 3 tbsp of kahlua into a small bowl and heat until warm. Add remaining 2 tbsp espresso powder and stir until dissolved.7. Combine kahlua espresso mixture, remaining kahlua and sweetened condensed milk in a medium sized bowl, then pour evenly over the warm cake.8. Refrigerate cake until cool.9. While cake cools, make the topping. Combine egg yolks and sugar in the top of a double boiler, over boiling water. If you don't have a double boiler, you can use a metal mixing bowl set over a pot.10. Cook for about 8-10 minutes, with heat on low, stirring constantly.11. When done, whip yolks with mixer until they thicken and yellow a bit.12. Add mascarpone to whipped yolks and mix until smooth, scraping down the sides as needed.13. If you have a second metal mixing bowl, use it for your whipped cream. If not, put mascarpone mixture into another bowl and get your metal mixer bowl clean.14. Place metal bowl and whisk into freezer for about 15-20 minutes.15. Remove bowl and whisk from freezer, add whipping cream to bowl and whip with mixer until stiff peaks form, about 5-7 minutes.16.

rack in the center of the oven. Pulse your cauliflower florets in a food processor until they resemble fine crumbles or couscous (don't over-process to a paste). Alternatively you can hand grate the cauliflower using the fine holes on your grater.Place the processed cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave it on high for 7 minutes. No need to add any liquid, the cauliflower will steam itself. While cauliflower is cooking, line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silpat.Take the cauliflower out and stir it repeatedly to release steam and cool it down, until it is lukewarm (not hot) to the touch.To the bowl with the cauliflower, add the mozzarella, egg, oregano, minced fresh garlic, turmeric, salt and cayenne pepper. Stir the mixture with a fork until well blended.Place the cauliflower mixture in a pile in the center of the lined baking sheet. Gently press out the mixture to form a 9-10 inch circle of even thickness, making sure to keep the center as thin as the edges. This is the beginning of your cauliflower \"crust.\"Use your fingers to gently press against the outer edge of the crust to form a small edge around the circle.Lay both hands flat in the center of the circle and GENTLY press to flatten out the middle, ensuring an even thickness throughout the crust.Place the crust into the hot oven and let it bake for about 20 minutes, turning the baking sheet around once halfway through baking, till the crust is golden brown. While crust is cooking, slice the tomatoes thin and shred or chiffonade the basil.Remove the crust from the oven and let it cool for 5-10 minutes. Use a spatula to very gently slide the cooked crust off of the parchment paper directly onto a greased baking sheet. Preheat your oven's broiler. Spread out the pesto onto the center surface of the crust to the outer edges. Sprinkle half of the goat cheese evenly across the top of the pesto. Lay the sliced tomatoes on, then sprinkle the rest of the goat cheese across the top. Sprinkle the surface evenly with crushed red pepper flakes.Place the tomato tart into the oven under the broiler. Broil for 3-4 minutes until hot and bubbly, keeping an eye on the crust to make sure it doesn't burn (it will get dark brown but shouldn't blacken).Remove the tart from the oven and sprinkle with fresh basil. Serve sliced warm or at room temperature. Keep in mind that the bottom \"crust\" of this tart will be slightly soft in the center.

Line the pan with plastic wrap, allowing it to overhang by 2 inches on two sides.

Sprinkle gelatin over it and let stand, stirring once or twice.Meanwhile, in a heavy, nonreactive (see Note) Dutch oven, stir together the remaining 1 1/2 cups cranberry juice concentrate, raspberries, cranberries, lemon zest, lemon juice and 3 cups sugar. Bring to a boil, stirring, over medium-high heat. Clip a candy thermometer to the pan, adjusting it so the tip is submerged but not touching the bottom. Boil briskly, stirring frequently, until the mixture cooks down slightly, 6 to 7 minutes. Lower the heat so the mixture boils gently and cook, stirring frequently, until it reaches 244F, about 25 minutes.Remove from heat. Add the gelatin mixture (it will be very firm by now), stirring until it completely dissolves. Immediately pour the jelly mixture into a fine sieve set over a nonreactive bowl. Force through as much juice and pulp as possible using a heatproof spatula or wooden spoon; work briskly, as the mixture will thicken as it cools. Transfer the jelly to the prepared pan.

Using a lightly oiled large sharp knife, trim off and discard the slab edges all around, forming clean edges. Cut the piece lengthwise and crosswise into eighths or tenths, forming individual jelly squares, cleaning and re-oiling the knife as necessary. Roll each square in sugar until coated on all sides. Let the jellies stand, uncovered, to dry for 4 hours, or overnight. Once dry, dust with additional sugar, covering all surfaces. Store the jellies, not touching each other, in single layers separated by wax paper (or in paper candy cups), in a flat, wax paper-lined storage container in the refrigerator.

Season to taste with salt and pepper.                                                                                    2                                                                                                                                                                                                   Transfer spinach to a fine mesh strainer set over the sink and press out excess moisture with a rubber spatula. Let spinach continue to drain as you prepare the ricotta mixture.                                                                                    3                                                                                                                                                                                                   For the Ricotta: Transfer half of the ricotta, both eggs, the Parmesan, and the nutmeg to the bowl of a food processor. Season with salt and pepper. Process until completely smooth, about 1 minute.                                                                                    4                                                                                                                                                                                                   Transfer mixture to a large bowl but do not wipe out food processor. Transfer spinach to food processor and pulse until finely chopped, 10 to 12 short pulses. Add spinach and remaining ricotta to the ricotta mixture and fold gently to combine.                                                                                    5                                              For the White Sauce: Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat until melted. Add flour and increase heat to medium high. Cook, stirring butter and flour with a whisk until paled golden blond, about 1 minute. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in milk. Continue to cook, whisking frequently, until mixture comes to a boil and thickens. Remove from heat and add 3/4 of mozzarella and Comté cheese. Whisk until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper.                                                                                    6                                              To Assemble: Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta sheets a few at a time and cook until barely tender, about 45 seconds. Transfer to a fine mesh strainer and run under cool water until well chilled. Transfer to a clean kitchen towel in a single layer. Continue until all pasta is par-cooked and dried.                                                                                    7                                                                                                                                                                                                   Drizzle a small amount of white sauce over the bottom of a lasagna pan or large casserole. Add a layer of noodles. Top with 1/12th of spinach mixture and 1/12th of remaining white sauce. Continue layering pasta, spinach, and white sauce until you lay down the top sheet of pasta.                                                                                    8                                                                                                                                                                                                   Spread remaining spinach mixture evenly over the top. Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella and Comté cheese and drizzle with remaining white sauce.

dish","dinner"],"diets":[],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"Prep the pans: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Fold a large sheet of parchment paper in half; put a 10-inch-round cake pan on top. Trace the cake pan, then cut out the circle to make two rounds of parchment. Spray two 10-inch cake pans with cooking spray; fit a parchment round into each. Spray the pans again, then dust with flour and tap out the excess.                          Make the batter: Pour the coffee into a liquid measuring cup or bowl; whisk in the cocoa powder. Put the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer; mix with the paddle attachment on low speed, 1 minute. Add the eggs, vegetable oil, vanilla and 2 cups water; beat on medium speed, 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low; beat in the coffee-cocoa mixture in a slow stream until combined. The batter will be thin.                          Bake the cakes: Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool in the pans on a rack, 10 minutes, then turn the cakes out onto the rack to cool completely. Place each cake on a 10-inch cardboard cake circle (this helps stabilize the layers as you move them around), wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.                          Make the ganache: Pulverize the bittersweet chocolate in a large food processor. Bring the cream just to a boil. With the motor running, pour the hot cream through the feed tube; process until smooth. Transfer to a large bowl and set in a bowl of ice water. Chill, stirring often, until the ganache is cool but not stiff, about 20 minutes.                          Make the bark: Microwave the white chocolate in 15-second intervals until two-thirds melted; stir to fully melt. Scrape into a zip-top bag and seal. Put a plastic sheet protector on each of 2 baking sheets. Snip a corner of the bag; pipe thin lines of white chocolate over the sheets.                          Refrigerate the baking sheets until the white chocolate is set, about 10 minutes, then repeat the process with the milk chocolate, piping thin lines over the white chocolate. Refrigerate until the milk chocolate is set.                          Melt the bittersweet chocolate in the same way, then spread over the white and milk chocolate lines using an offset spatula. Refrigerate until hard, about 30 minutes.                          Peel the sheet protectors off the chocolate and break the chocolate sheets into shards of various sizes.                          Slice the layers: Put one cake on a cake turntable. Position a long serrated knife against the side of the cake, about halfway down. Slowly rotate the turntable so the knife slices the cake in half horizontally. Don't move the knife much-let the rotation of the turntable do the work. Repeat with the other cake to make 4 layers; transfer each to a cardboard circle. (If you don't have a turntable, carefully slice the cakes in half on a cutting board.)                          Frost the cake: Transfer half of the ganache to a bowl and whisk until light brown and fluffy. Place one cake layer (still on a cardboard circle) on the turntable; spoon one-third of the whipped ganache on top. Rotate the turntable to smooth the ganache with a long spatula (or just assemble and frost on a cake plate). Repeat to sandwich all 4 cake layers with whipped ganache. Spread all but about 1/2 cup of the unwhipped ganache over the top and sides of the cake.                          Decorate the cake: Press the chocolate bark against the sides of the cake, using small dollops of the remaining ganache to help the pieces stick, if necessary.

Put the Cheddar and pork on 2 quarter-sheet trays and freeze just until firm, about 1 hour.                          Using a stand mixer fitted with the coarse grind attachment, grind the pork into the bowl of the stand mixer. Add 1 tablespoon salt, the pepper and sage and toss to combine. If the meat feels warm, place it in the freezer for a few minutes until it cools. Switch to the fine grind attachment and regrind the meat mixture. Add the milk and mushrooms to the meat mixture and switch to the paddle attachment. Mix until evenly dispersed. Add the Cheddar and stir until combined.                          Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a wire rack.                          Bring a 6-quart saucepan full of water to a boil. Divide the meat mixture into 8 equal portions or use a 1-cup ice cream scoop to measure out eight portions. Using plastic wrap as the casing, roll each portion of meat into a 6- to 7-inch sausage link. Twist the ends tightly and wrap a second piece of plastic wrap around each sausage to prevent water from getting in. Place the sausages in the boiling water and cook until the outsides turn whitish and set up, about 6 minutes. Remove from the water, take off the plastic wrap and place on the prepared baking sheet. Bake the sausages until golden brown and firm to the touch, 15 to 20 minutes.                          Place on a bun, top with mustard, and enjoy.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Season the mushroom with 1 teaspoon salt and set aside in a bowl in the refrigerator to allow it to release any moisture.","ingredients":[{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Put the Cheddar and pork on 2 quarter-sheet trays and freeze just until firm, about 1 hour.","ingredients":[{"id":1009,"name":"cheddar cheese","image":"cheddar-cheese.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Using a stand mixer fitted with the coarse grind attachment, grind the pork into the bowl of the stand mixer.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404665,"name":"stand mixer","image":"stand-mixer.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":5,"step":"Add 1 tablespoon salt, the pepper and sage and toss to combine.

Place chicken breast on the bone, with skin, in a covered baking dish.  Bake until juices run clear when pierced with a fork, after about 45 minutes. Chicken should have reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees. Allow to cool. Remove skin and bones, discard. Shred chicken or cut into bite-sized cubes. In a medium mixing bowl add chicken, garlic powder, cumin, chili powder, black pepper, and salt to taste.  Add to seasoned chicken: green chile peppers, 1/2 cup of enchilada sauce, 1/2 cup sour cream, and 1 cup cheese. Mix well. Place 1/2 cup chicken mixture in the center of each tortilla. Leave about 2\" in the bottom without filling and fold up. Continue until all tortillas are filled.Lightly spray the bottom and the sides of the slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray. We like to make our own cooking spray by filling this reusable cooking spray bottle with olive or canola oil. Lay enchiladas seam side down in the slow cooker, add a little of the sauce above each layer as you stack them. There should be 2 layers of 3 or 3 layers of 2, depending on the size of your slow cooker. Combine the remaining enchilada sauce and 1/2 cup sour cream. Pour over the enchiladas. Cover and cook on low 3 to 4 hours, or until hot and bubbly. Cut between each enchilada, and carefully remove them, one at a time, with a large spatula.  Pour liquid from slow cooker over enchiladas and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Garnish with diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place chicken breast on the bone, with skin, in a covered baking dish.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404646,"name":"baking pan","image":"roasting-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Bake until juices run clear when pierced with a fork, after about 45 minutes.

Turn goose tail side down, and repeat the process. Remove goose from the pot, and drain. Place breast side up on a rack in a large roasting pan. Set in the refrigerator, uncovered, to dry the skin for 24 to 48 hours.                            Cook the rice the night before roasting the goose: place the rice in a pot with 5 cups water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 45 minutes. Refrigerate overnight.                            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
