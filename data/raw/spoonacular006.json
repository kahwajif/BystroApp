pepper flakes. Bring the pan to medium heat and cook the bacon until brown and crispy, 6 to 7 minutes. Spoon out 2 tablespoons of the rendered bacon fat from the pan and reserve. Add the onions and tomatoes and season with salt. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes and onions are soft and very aromatic, 12 to 15 minutes. Taste and reseason if needed. Stir in the oregano. Keep warm until ready to serve.                          For the toast and wilted spinach: Preheat a cast-iron griddle pan over medium-high heat. Once heated, add the butter and melt. Once melted, add the Pullman rounds and toast on both sides until golden brown, about 1 minute per side.

Sprinkle 6 tablespoons of the ice water over the mixture. Stir and press the dough together, using a stiff rubber spatula until the dough sticks together. If the dough does not come together, stir in the remaining water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it does.3. Divide the dough into two even pieces and flatten each into a 4-inch disk. Wrap the disks tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Let the chilled dough soften slightly at room temperature before rolling it out and fitting one of the pieces into the bottom of a pie plate.  To make ahead: The dough can be refrigerated, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 2 months. Let the frozen dough thaw on the countertop until malleable before rolling.Make the pie4. Roll one dough disk on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle. Fold dough in quarters, then place dough point in center of 9-inch Pyrex regular or deep dish pie pan. Unfold dough. Gently press dough into sides of pan leaving portion that overhangs lip of pie plate in place. Refrigerate while preparing fruit.5. Adjust an oven rack to the lowest position, place a rimmed baking sheet on the rack, and heat the oven to 500°F (260°C).

Spread the apples in the unbaked pie crust bottom, mounding them slightly in the middle. Loosely roll the top crust around the rolling pin, then gently unroll it over the apples. Trim all but 1/2-inch of the dough overhanging the edge of the pie plate with scissors. Seal the edge by pressing the top and bottom crusts together, then tuck the edges underneath. Crimp the edges, and cut four vent holes in the top. Brush the crust with the egg white and sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar.7. Place the pie on the heated baking sheet and lower the oven temperature to 425°F (220°C). Bake until the top crust is golden, about 25 minutes. Rotate the baking sheet, reduce the oven temperature again to 375°F (190°C), and continue to bake until the juices are bubbling and the crust is deep golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes longer.

Heat the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering hot. Arrange the fish skin side down in the pan so the fillets fit without touching. Cook undisturbed for 4 minutes. With a spatula, peek under a fillet to see if the skin is golden-brown and crisp. If not, cook 1 minute more. Flip the fillets and cook until lightly golden-brown and just cooked through, an additional 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack set over a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven.

Add the tomatoes,1/2 tsp. salt, and 3 Tbs. water and cook until they become saucy, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the chickpeas and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Add the preserved lemon (or lemon zest) and chopped cilantro. Season to taste with salt and pepper.    Scrape a fork through the couscous to fluff it, and then divide it among 4 dinner plates. Place the fish skin side up on the couscous. Spoon on the chickpea mixture and garnish with the harissa and a scattering of cilantro leaves. If desired, drizzle extra-virgin olive oilover the fish at the table.    Serving Suggestions    This dish is a complete meal in itself, but you could start it off with a simple salad.                   nutrition information (per serving):        Calories                        (kcal):                      550, Fat                        (kcal):                      16, Fat Calories                        (g):                      150, Saturated Fat                        (g):                      2.5, Protein                        (g):                      39, Monounsaturated Fat                        (g):                      9, Carbohydrates                        (mg):                      61, Polyunsaturated Fat                        (mg):                      3.5, Sodium                        (g):                      600, Cholesterol                        (g):                      115, Fiber                        (g):                      9,                     Photo: Scott Phillips          Rate this Recipe and View Reviews","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat the oven to 200F.

Add one of the candy cooking squares to a ramekin or small bowl that has a diameter slightly larger than the top of the ice cream cone.  Melt the candy coating in a microwave for 30 second bursts making sure to stir between each 30 seconds.  Dip the top of the ice cream cone in the candy coating. You may need to tilt the bowl slightly so the coating covers the area that is about an inch to two inches from the top of the cone.  Then sprinkle the decorative candies on top of the candy coating.  Next, set the bottom of the cone in the candy coating tilting the bowl slightly so the coating covers the area that is about an inch to two inches from the bottom of the cone.Set the bottom of the cone on the parchment paper and let the candy coating dry (about 30 minutes).  The candy coating on the bottom helps to give the cone a better \"footing\" so that it doesn't tip over when the popcorn is stacked on the top.  After dipping two of the cones in the coating, add the other square of candy coating to the bowl and melt it in the microwave.  Then dip the remaining cones and decorate with the candy sprinkles.  For the Popcorn and Caramel Chocolate Filling:  While the candy coating hardens, pop the popcorn, add salt, and set aside.  Unwrap the caramels and add them to a medium size pan.  Heat the pan on low to medium heat and stir constantly.Add the water and continue to stir.  Once the caramels are melted, remove the pan from the heat and set aside for a quick moment.  In a small bowl, melt the candy coating in a microwave for 30 second bursts making sure to stir between each 30 seconds.  Drizzle the caramel in the bottom of the ice cream cone (about 2 teaspoons).  Then drizzle the chocolate in the cone (about 2 teaspoons).Next, sprinkle some of the toffee bits in the bottom of the cone.  Add the popcorn until it reaches the top of the cone.  Then drizzle more of the caramel and chocolate, and top with the toffee bits.  Next add as much popcorn to the top of the chocolate that will stick.  Add more kernels of popcorn by dipping them in the caramel so they’ll stick.  When adding them, try to make an overall shape that looks like a scoop of ice cream.  Lastly, drizzle caramel and chocolate over the popcorn and top with toffee bits.  The caramel hardens quickly so you may need to warm it up on the stove a couple times in between making the cones.  Let the caramel and chocolate harden on top of the popcorn before serving (about an hour).","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the Candy Coated Cones:  Lay a piece of parchment paper over a cookie sheet.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404770,"name":"baking paper","image":"baking-paper.jpg"},{"id":404727,"name":"baking sheet","image":"baking-sheet.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add one of the candy cooking squares to a ramekin or small bowl that has a diameter slightly larger than the top of the ice cream cone.

then turn it off when it’s heated, this is as warm as it should get.In large measuring cup, mix together milk, water, melted butter, sugar, and yeast.This recipe is as easy to do by hand as it is by mixer, so pick your poison.If you would like to use a stand mixer, mix flour and salt into the mixer bowl that is fitted with a oiled dough hook. Oiling the hook makes sure the dough doesn’t climb the hook and go all crazy on you. Works like a charm!Using the lowest setting, start the dough hook going and slowly add the milk mixture. After dough comes together, increase speed to medium and let your dough hook do the work until the dough is shiny and smooth, about 6 to 7 minutes. The dough should be slightly sticky but if it is too wet to come together into a ball, add an additional 2 tablespoons flour. It should just barely stick to your hands, nothing more. Turn dough onto lightly floured counter and knead briefly to form a smooth, round ball.If you are ready for a workout and want to do this by hand, mix flour and salt in large bowl. Make a well in the flour, then add the milk mixture, pouring into the well. Using a wooden spoon, stir until the dough is difficult to stir and it’s almost a ball in the middle of the bowl. Turn out onto lightly floured work surface and begin to knead, incorporating any loose scraps back into the dough. Knead until dough is smooth and satiny, about 10 minutes, giving those arms a workout and a half! Shape into a round ball.Take the ball of dough and place in a well oiled bowl, covering it up. Put it the oven and let the dough rise until doubled in size, anywhere from 45-60 minutes.When that is done, grease your bundt pan and set aside.Pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees.Take out the dough and on a lightly floured work surface roll it into a 12 by 18 inch rectangle.Cut the rectangle into (6) 12 inch long strips. Each strip will then be approximately 3 inches wide.Take the first strip, brush melted butter over it and sprinkle brown sugar on top.Place as many cherries on top for filling as wanted, I did 10 half cherries per strip.Place the next strip directly on top of the previously prepared one and repeat the butter, sugar and cherries.Repeat with all layers, buliding a stack of dough layers.Once you have all the layers in a stack, cut it into 12 pieces.Place each piece in the prepared bundt pan, making sure that they will slant slightly so that each piece will rise and touch together, forming a solid pull apart loaf.Cover with a towel and let rise for another 45-60 minutes, until the dough is doubled again.Bake in the oven for 35-40 minutes. You should cover the top of the loaf once it's browned and continue cooking. To avoid a soggy loaf, you must make sure it's very well baked without burning the top, thus using tinfoil to prevent the top from over baking is crucial.Once the loaf is cooled, combine all the cream cheese icing ingredients together, making sure the brown sugar is dissolved in completely. It is SO much better than icing sugar!Spread over the top of the loaf and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat your oven for rising, turn it on to 175 degrees then turn it off when it’s heated, this is as warm as it should get.In large measuring cup, mix together milk, water, melted butter, sugar, and yeast.This recipe is as easy to do by hand as it is by mixer, so pick your poison.If you would like to use a stand mixer, mix flour and salt into the mixer bowl that is fitted with a oiled dough hook.

it into cubes.  Cook it using a pressure cooker (add water just enough to cover the pumpkin pieces and leave it for 1 whistle or in a microwave oven.  Drain the water and blend the cooked pieces into a smooth puree when it is cool enough.  Measure 1 and 1/2 cups of this puree. (Check My Notes for store bought pumpkin puree).Empty the entire tin of evaporated milk in a medium size sauce pan.  Heat it on low-medium.  Once the skin starts forming in the milk; add the pumpkin puree and mix it well.  Heat this mixture for another 7-8 minutes.  Do not be tempted to increase the heat because chances are that the milk will get burnt and will stick to the bottom of the vessel giving an unpleasant taste later.Add a tin of condensed milk and the MTR powder to the above and let this mixture remain on stove for another 5 minutes.  This should also be done on low heat.  Remove the pan from heat.In a small cup add the saffron strands and couple drops of the hot milk; leave it for a while. After 2-3 minutes, dissolve the saffron in the milk with the tip of your fingers.  Add this to the pumpkin mixture.Now add the cardamom powder, salt and nuts and mix well; let it cool completely.  You can drink this as kheer/payasam or you can freeze it as kulfis.  If you decide to drink it, I would suggest adding some more milk because the kheer will be very sweet.Once it is cold, pour the mixture in the molds and freeze it.  I froze it overnight but 7-8 hours should be enough I guess.To serve it you can either dip it in hot water for just a few seconds so unmolding will be easy. (I got this idea from Jyoti).

350 degrees Fahrenheit. Slice the top of a head of garlic off so that the cloves are exposed and gently rub your fingers back and forth over the sides to remove as much of the paper as you can. Drizzle the cloves with olive oil, and wrap the head tightly in aluminum foil. Roast the garlic until the cloves are caramel in color, about 45 minutes. Allow the garlic to cool completely before squeezing out the cloves. Set aside.Marinate the Chicken:For the chicken, add the chicken to a large baking dish or resealable plastic bag. Whisk together 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, the lemon zest, and juice, garlic, dill, vinegar, honey, salt and pepper. Pour it over the chicken and toss it to coat. Place the dish or bag in the refrigerator and marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight.While the chicken is marinating, prep the tzatziki. Combine all of the ingredients together in a large bowl and mix them together until combined. Store the dip in the fridge until ready to use.Prepare the Whipped Feta:For the whipped feta, preheat the broiler in your oven to high and move an oven rack directly below it. Place the jalapeo peppers on a baking sheet. Once the broiler is hot, set the baking sheet underneath to roast the peppers. As soon as the skin begins to char and bubble, pull the baking sheet out and rotate the peppers to roast all sides. This should take about 5 minutes. Immediately remove the peppers and place them in a resealable plastic bag (note:or bowl covered with plastic wrap) for 2o minutes. The bag will steam up.After 20 minutes, remove the peppers from the bag and gently push and peel the charred skin on the peppers to remove it. Slice the tops of the peppers off and cut them in half. Remove the seeds and cut the peppers into pieces.Add the feta cheese and cream cheese to a food processor. Puree until the cheese are completed blended and smooth, then add the chopped jalapeo peppers, the roasted garlic cloves, the lemon zest and juice, and the salt and pepper. Blend again until all of the ingredients are combined. If you are serving the dish within the next 2 hours, the feta can sit at room temperature. Otherwise, store it in a sealed container in the fridge and set it out an hour before serving.Prepare Pitas:For the pitas, remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the juices. You can cook the chicken any way you like--I find the quickest method to be heating a large skillet over medium heat and adding the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Put the chicken in the skillet and cook it until golden and brown on both sides, 10 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the skillet and let it rest for 1 to 2 minutes. Cut it into pieces or shred it.Assemble the pitas by heating the pitas in the oven or microwave for a minute or two. Spread the feta dip on the pitas, then top with chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, hummus, and tzatziki.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Roast Garlic:Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

With a paring knife, dig into the part underneath the crown, and make a circular incision. Youre removing the crown and a bit of the skin underneath it so that the pomegranate is easier to peel later. Score the pomegranate.Tear the pomegranate apart into different sections. Remove the arils by prying them loose from the peel. If you want to prevent pomegranate juice from splattering everywhere, remove the arils inside a large bowl filled with water.When youre done, youll notice that most of the seeds have sunken to the bottom of the bowl, and the loose membrane will float on the top. Its okay if some of the arils are floating too. Remove any stray pieces of membrane, and drain all the water.Pour the arils into a high-speed blender or food processor, and pulse until all the arils are crushed. The airls should crush pretty easily. Its okay if the seeds are not pulverized. You may need to do this step in batches.Strain the juice through a fine-mesh strainer. Use a spatula to press down on the pure so that you can squeeze out as much juice as possible. You should end up with 3 1/2 cups of pomegranate juice.Add the pomegranate juice, sugar and lemon juice in a saucepan and stir to dissolve the sugar. Bring everything to a boil. Then, reduce the heat to medium-low or low so that the juice gently simmers. I transfer my saucepan to a smaller burner and leave it on the medium-low setting. If you are cooking this on a large burner, youll want to keep it on low.

and sauté onion and garlic over high heat until onion is translucent and most of the water has cooked off, about 2 minutes. Add chili powder, cumin, a light dash of paprika, and a very light dash of cinnamon, stirring to coat everything. Continue to cook for about a minute, until fragrant and most of the liquid has cooked off. Add beans (with juices) and stir to combine. Reduce heat to low and mash beans well with a fork or potato masher a few times. You still want some whole and half beans and not a refried consistency. It will look very soupy; don’t be alarmed. Crank the heat to high and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-high and cook for 10 minutes. If it’s popping, cover for a few minutes, until it cooks down and stops popping. Stir the beans every minute or so, taking care to scrape the bottom and lift the beans. After 10 minutes, the mixture should have significantly reduced. It may still be a little soupy, that is all right — it will thicken as it cools — but if it’s really soupy, cook longer. Set aside and prepare \"plantains\" (recipe below). Once bananas are ready, add hot sauce (or cayenne powder) and lime juice and zest to taste, squeezing some lime over the bananas as well. Plate, serving bananas next to beans, or on top. Side of rice if desired. Season with salt and pepper and serve.For the \"plantains\":Slice peeled bananas into 1-inch chunks, and then slice each chunk in half lengthwise (down the center of the banana). Heat a nonstick skillet over high heat. You’ll know it’s ready when a drop of water sizzles. Divide banana chunks in half, setting half aside. Place the slimy insides facing down on the skillet, one at a time, in a row. It is important to remember the order, because as soon as you finish putting the last piece down, it’s time to flip the first one. When they’ve all been flipped once, remove one by one and set aside. Clean out the skillet and reheat if necessary. Repeat with remaining banana pieces. Once \"fried\" to perfection, drizzle with lime juice.Nutritional InformationServing Size: 1Servings Per Batch:                                     2Amount Per ServingCalories                                     338Fat                                     2.50g                                      Carbohydrate                                     67.90gDietary Fiber15.30gSugars17.30gProtein14.70g","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the beans:Line a skillet with a thin layer of water and sauté onion and garlic over high heat until onion is translucent and most of the water has cooked off, about 2 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":11282,"name":"onion","image":"brown-onion.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}],"length":{"number":2,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Add chili powder, cumin, a light dash of paprika, and a very light dash of cinnamon, stirring to coat everything.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"In a heavy-bottomed pot on medium-low heat, combine goat milk, vanilla bean paste, and sugar.

The zucchini will cook the quickest so make sure that comes off first. When flipping the thick slices of onion, I found that the easiest way is to leave them in thick slices and not to separate and use tongs to gently turn so they stay together. Otherwise the individual slices will fall between grates of the grill.Stem the cooked zucchini and cut into bite sized pieces. Remove corn from cob by running a sharp knife down all sides.
