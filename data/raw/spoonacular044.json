One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"To get started, heat your oven to 350 and prepare an 8x8 baking dish.

d'oeuvre"],"diets":["gluten free","lacto ovo vegetarian"],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Prepare the 6-inch cake pans by cutting a circle of parchment paper to line the bottom (place the cake pan on the parchment paper, trace around it with a pencil and cut out).  Using a stiff pastry brush, brush a light coat of softened butter on the pan bottom, insert parchment circle, smooth out wrinkles or bubbles.  Brush a light coat of butter over the parchment and on the pan sides.  Place a small amount of gluten-free flour in the pan; swirl it around to coat the bottom and sides of the pan.  Turn upside down and tap pan to release any excess flour.                    In the bowl of a standing mixer combine the eggs and sugar.  Beat on medium-low for 2-3 minutes until mixture is thick and creamy.                    While the eggs and sugar are beating, in a separate medium mixing bowl combine the milk, oil, lime juice, vanilla and rose extracts.                    In a second medium mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt and baking powder.  Stir to fully incorporate.                    Continue running the mixer at medium speed.  Alternate adding the wet ingredient mixture and flour mixture into the mixing bowl with the eggs and sugar until fully combined.                    If desired add food coloring and mix to fully combine.                    Evenly fill the prepared cake pans and place in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes until the top of the cake has risen and bounces back when lightly pressed.  Remove from the oven and place pans on a cooling rack for 15 minutes.                    After cooling in the pan for 15 minutes, run a knife along the inside of the cake pan and gently invert the cake layers onto a cooling rack; remove the parchment paper and allow to cool fully (important for gluten-free cakes to retain their structure).                    In the bowl of a food processor, process the pistachio nuts until they are granulated and beginning to stick together.  Add the butter and sugar. Pulse to fully combine.                    In a chilled bowl of free standing mixer with whisk attachment, combine the heavy whipping cream and vanilla.  Beat until stiff peaks form.                    Fold the pistachio-butter into the whipped cream until it is fully mixed together.                    In the chilled bowl of a standing mixer with whisk attachment combine the heavy whipping cream, sugar and vanilla.                    Beat on low speed to combine the ingredients.  Add a very small amount of food coloring to create a pale pink color (if desired).  Increase speed to high and beat until stiff peaks form.                    Level all four layers of the cake so they are flat on top.  Place the bottom layer on a cardboard cake round or serving platter.                    Divide the Pistachio Cream into third.  Spread one third onto the top of the bottom layer.  Add the second cake layer and repeat with the second third of Pistachio Cream.   Add the third cake layer and repeat with the final third of Pistachio Cream.  Place the fourth cake layer on top.                    Frost the cake with the Whipped Cream Frosting.  Serve immediately.  Cake can be refrigerated for a short time before serving however the whipped cream frosting is best served shortly after frosting.

Let apples cook and caramelize, about 15 minutes, stirring every so often (reduce heat as needed). Remove skillet from heat and stir in vanilla. Set apples aside to cool.2.   Prepare Waffle Pastries: Preheat waffle iron. Unfold puff pastry. Use sharp knife and cut along seams to create three rectangles. Cut each rectangle into thirds. You should have nine square pieces of puff pastry (about 2 1/2-inch x 3-inch). Combine sugar and cinnamon: Sprinkle tops of puff pastry squares with cinnamon-sugar mixture.3.   Spray waffle iron with nonstick spray. Place puff pastry onto waffle iron (two at a time) and close waffle iron. It should only take 2 or 3 minutes for the pastry to puff up and turn golden brown. Gently lift the waffle iron to watch progress and remove the waffles when done. Repeat with remaining pastry dough. Set pastry waffles aside to cool.4.   Prepare whipped cream: Using electric mixer, beat whipping cream until stiff peaks form. Add cinnamon and vanilla.5.   Assembly: Place waffle pastries on serving platter and top with caramelized apples, drizzling pan juices too. Pipe whipped cream on top of the apples.
