Just keep in mind that the jaggery should not be over cooked as then your mixture would become very sticky and hard.When done, add the cardamom powder and mix well.In a pan or dekchi add the water, oil and salt.Keep this pan on the flame and let the contents heat up till the mixture comes to a rolling boil.Remove the pan from the fire and add the rice flour to it. Add small portions of rice flour.Keep on mixing as you want the mixture to be free from lumps and smooth. If the mixture becomes dry, add little water. If it gets a thin consistency, add a little rice flour. Consistency is very important here as you do not want the dough to break when making the modaks.Mix all the rice flour and keep on mixing with a wooden spoon or spatula.Now keep this pan with the rice flour on low flame and keep on stirring till the rice mixture becomes thick and one solid mass.Cover the mixture for 5-6 minutes.When the mixture is slightly hot or warm, then knead the mixture.You can apply some oil on your palms while kneading the rice flour dough.Apply some water or oil on your palm. Take a small portion of the rice dough and make a smooth ball out of it with your hands. Keep this rice flour dough ball on your palm.Now flatten this dough ball in your palm with the fingers of the other hand. Make a small puri of it on your palm.Keep a small portion of the jaggery-coconut mixture on the center of this puri.Bring together all the edges together and close the top.Remove the extra portion of the dough from the top.Shape and taper the top of the modak with your fingers.Make all the modaks this way.Steam the modaks for 7-10 mins on a low to medium flame in a pressure cooker without the whistle. You can also steam in a steamer.Some modaks may crack whilst steaming as was the case with me, buts its alright.

Add butter and microwave on high, until the butter melts and the mixture is warmed to 120F to 130F (it should feel warm but not hot.) Start with 30 seconds, then microwave in 10 second intervals, until the desired temperature is reached. Once heated, pour into the bowl of standing mixer fitted with paddle attachment or a large mixing bowl.Add white whole wheat flour, granulated sugar, egg, vanilla, yeast, salt, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves. Beat on low speed for 3 minutes, stopping occasionally to scrape down sides of bowl. Add 2 and 1/2 cups all purpose flour. Beat on low speed, until the flour is absorbed and the dough is no longer sticky, scraping down sides of bowl as you go. If dough is very sticky, add more flour one tablespoon at a time, combining after each, just until dough begins to form a shaggy ball and pulls away from sides of bowl. It should still feel somewhat sticky and tacky.If using a stand mixer, fit the mixer with a dough hook and knead on medium low for 6 minutes, until smooth and elastic. If kneading by hand, turn the dough out onto lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Add a little flour, one tablespoon at a time, go if the dough is too sticky. Lightly oil a large, clean bowl with cooking spray. Form dough into a ball and place it in the bowl, turning once to coat with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. Let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.Make the filling: If using a chocolate bar, roughly chop the chocolate into chunks. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade, place the chocolate granulated sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, ground ginger, salt, black pepper, and cloves. Pulse until the chocolate is very finely chopped and some parts are powdery. Add the butter and pulse again, until the butter is evenly distributed throughout the chocolate. (If you do not have a food processor, chop the chocolate very finely, then stir in the sugar, spices, salt, pepper, and butter until you have a rough paste.) Add candied ginger and pulse a few additional times, just until barely combined. Set mixture aside.Form the rolls: Once the dough has doubled, turn it out onto a well-floured work surface. (To test if the dough has completed rising, gently press it with your first two fingers; if the indentation remains, the dough is ready.) Roll the dough into a 16-inch x 12-inch rectangle (be sure to measure.) Sprinkle the filling evenly over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border uncovered on each side. It might seem like too much filling, but use all of it. Starting at one of the long edges, roll the dough into a tight log, then tightly pinch the end to seal. Turn log so that the seam side is down, then carefully trim each end so that they are straight. (The end scraps can be baked separately in lightly greased ramekins.) Gently stretch and pat the log as needed so that it is 18 inches in length and roughly even in diameter. With a serrated knife, gently saw the log into 18 1-inch segments.Lightly mist two 9 x 9-inch baking pans with cooking spray (a square 8 x 8-inch pan or round 9-inch pan will work as well.) Arrange the rolls in the pans, cut sides up, dividing the rolls evenly between each. Cover the baking dishes with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes. (It may take a bit longer but is worth the wait).Place rack in the center of your oven and preheat to 375F. Bake rolls until the tops are golden and the centers reach 185F to 190F, 20-25 minutes. Check the rolls at the 15 minute markif they begin to brown too quickly, cover the pan with foil and continue baking until complete. Remove from oven and place pan on a cooling rack for 5 minutes.While the rolls bake, prepare the glaze: Stir together the sifted powdered sugar, half and half, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves. Once rolls have cooled 5 minutes, drizzle over the rolls using the tines of a fork or a small spoon, and serve warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Prepare the dough","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Pour milk into a large glass measuring cup.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404766,"name":"measuring cup","image":"measuring-cup.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add butter and microwave on high, until the butter melts and the mixture is warmed to 120F to 130F (it should feel warm but not hot.)

Combine the milks and vanilla bean and seeds in a medium nonreactive saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat.                          Whisk together the yolks, sugar and cornstarch in a large bowl. Slowly whisk the warm milk into the egg mixture then return the mixture to the pot over medium heat and bring to a boil, whisking constantly, until thickened. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and whisk in the rum and vanilla extract. Let cool to room temperature then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours.                          Combine the custard and cream in a bowl and whip until soft peaks form.                          Beat the butter and sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the coconut custard and salt and beat until combined and smooth.                          Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour 2 (9 by 2-inch) round cake pans and line bottoms with parchment paper.                          Whisk together the milk, egg whites, vanilla bean seeds and vanilla extract in a medium bowl.                          In the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. With mixer running at low speed, add the butter, one piece at a time and continue beating until mixture resembles moist crumbs. Add all but 1/2 cup of milk mixture to crumbs and beat at medium speed until the mixture is pale and fluffy, about 1 1/2 minutes. With mixer on low speed, add remaining 1/2 cup of the milk mixture, increase speed to medium and beat 30 seconds more. Scrape sides of bowl and mix for 20 seconds longer. Divide the batter evenly between the cakes pan and smooth the tops using a rubber spatula.                          Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few crumbs attached, 22 to 24 minutes. Cool in the pan on baking rack for 10 minutes. Run a small knife around the side of the pan and invert cakes onto the baking rack, removing parchment paper, and let cool completely, about 45 minutes.                          Using a long serrated knife, slice each cake horizontally into 2 layers. Reserve 1 of the flat bottom layers for the top of the cake. Place another layer on a cardboard round cut side up and brush with some of the coconut simple syrup. Spoon 1/3 of the coconut filling onto the cake and using a small offset metal spatula, spread it into an even layer, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge of the cake. Repeat with 2 more layers. Brush the cut side of the reserved cake layer with the remaining syrup. Place the layer cut side down on top of the cake.                          Frost the sides and top of the cake with the buttercream. Pat the coconut onto the sides of the cake and sprinkle the remaining coconut on the top of the cake.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch how to make this recipe.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":325,"unit":"Fahrenheit"}}]},{"number":3,"step":"Spread the coconut evenly onto a baking sheet and toast until lightly golden brown, stirring once, 8 to 10 minutes.

Attems Cupra Ramato boasts a rich, fruity bouquet, and opens full and weighty on the palate, with multi-faceted flavors.It is perfect when paired with fatty fish, with delicate or vegetable-based antipasti, the ideal companion to summer dishes, and is delicious as well as an aperitif.","price":"$13.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/452761-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":5,"score":0.8175000000000001,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fattems-ramato-pinot-grigio-2014%2F160114"}]},"instructions":"Place the prawn shells and heads in a pot and add the stock, bay leaves, peppercorns, salt, lemon peel and garlic.

Turn off heat and cover saucepan, and let steep for 10 minutes.Preheat oven to 325 minutes.Whisk egg yolks and sugar together in a medium bowl.Slowly pour about half of the cream mixture into the eggs, whisking constantly to temper the eggs. Pour the rest of the cream mixture in and whisk to combine.Add in vanilla extract and salt and whisk to combine. Strain the custard if desired to get rid of any lumps.Remove ramekins from freezer and divide custard mixture among the cups.Place ramekins in a large baking or roasting pan. Carefully fill the pan with hot water, taking care not to get water in the ramekins. Carefully place the pan into the oven.Bake for 40-45 minutes, until the custards seems mostly set and the centers still jiggle slightly. When the custards are done, they should shimmy slightly when you move the pan (careful not to spill water!) but the center should not move separately. If, however, it has set like Jello and there are bubbles forming on the top it is becoming overcooked and you should remove the custards immediately. If the custards start rising at any point they have become overcooked.Remove pan from oven. Take ramekins out of the water and place on wire rack to cool.When ramekins are cool enough to touch, cover and chill for at least 4 hours in the refrigerator.When you are ready to serve the crme brles, take one ramekin at a time and sprinkle the top with sugar evenly over the top. Using a hand-held blowtorch, carefully caramelize the sugar. Keep the flame at least 2 inches from the sugar to prevent burning the sugar. You can also caramelize the sugar under a broiler.Let the sugar cool for a couple of minutes before serving. Do not brle the custards more than 20 minutes before serving or the sugar may melt.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine cocoa powder, sugar, water, and salt in a medium saucepan.

First, make the pizza dough. In a glass measuring cup or small bowl, combine yeast and 1 cup warm water. Add a pinch of sugar and let sit for 5 minutes.2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the flour and salt. Mix the ingredients until combined.3. Add the yeast mixture to the flour mixture. Next, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Mix until combined. Switch to the dough hook and knead for about 5 minutes on medium speed.4. Spray a large bowl with cooking spray. Form dough into a ball and place in the bowl. Cover pizza dough with a damp towel and set in a warm area to rise. Let the dough rise for 1 hour or until dough has doubled in size.5. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Cut the dough in half. Take one piece of dough and punch it down on a lightly floured surface. You can refrigerate or freeze the other half of the dough or make 2 pizzas, if you wish. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out into a circle. Place the pizza dough on a pizza pan or pizza stone. 6. Evenly brush the olive oil on the pizza. Top with fresh mozzarella slices. Add the parmesan cheese. Place the pizza in the oven and bake for 12-15 minutes or until pizza crust is golden and cheese is melted.7. Remove the pizza from the oven and place arugula on top. Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the arugula and season with salt and black pepper, to taste. Garnish with additional parmesan cheese, if desired. Cut into slices and serve.Note-we made a thin crust pizza. Josh rolled the crust into about a 13-inch circle.
