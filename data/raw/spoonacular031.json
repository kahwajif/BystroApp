Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicon mats. Prepare a pastry bag with a plain round tip (about ½-inch) so it's ready to go.Use a food processor to grind together the powdered sugar, almond flour, and cocoa so there are no lumps. Pulse a five or six times to make sure the almond flouf is finely ground.In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Without stopping the mixer, beat in the granulated sugar until the peaks are stiff and firm, about 2 minutes.Carefully fold the dry ingredients, in two batches, into the beaten egg whites with a flexible rubber spatula. Be very careful not to over mix and flatten the whites. When the mixture is just smooth and there are no large streaks of egg white, stop folding.

Remove from the heat and let the pan sit, covered, for 10 minutes. Add the green onions and fluff with a fork. Cover to keep warm.Meanwhile, combine the oil, garlic and remaining 3 tablespoons of chili powder in a large saucepan set over medium-high heat. Cook until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Stir in the tomato sauce and remaining 1 cup of chicken broth. Bring to a simmer. Nestle the chicken into the sauce, then cover and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and cook until the chicken registers 160F, 10 to 15 minutes, flipping the chicken halfway through cooking.Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and allow to cool slightly. Use 2 forks to shred the chicken. Place the chicken in a bowl then toss the chicken with  cup of the cooking sauce plus 2 tablespoons of cilantro. Set the remaining sauce aside.Place the oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 450F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.Wrap the tortillas in a damp towel and microwave until they are soft and pliable, about 1 minute. Lay the tortillas on a work surface, then place a mound of rice down each tortilla, close to the edge. Top with some of the chicken, avocado, and Monterey Jack cheese. Fold the sides then the bottom over the filling, rolling tightly into a burrito. Place the burritos seam side down on the baking sheet, cover with foil, and cook until heated through, 20-30 minutes.Before serving, whisk the salsa and 2 tablespoons of cilantro together in a bowl. Cover and microwave on high for 1 minute. Reheat the red sauce in the saucepan over medium heat until hot, adding water as needed to loosen the sauce.Arrange the burritos on individual plates. Pour the tomatillo sauce over one half of each burrito, and the red sauce over the other half.

Add farmer's cheese, cheddar cheese, soy sauce, sesame oil, fermented bean paste, cilantro, black pepper, and sichuan peppercorns and toss to combine, taking care not to break down the potatoes too much. There should still be discernible chunks of potatoes in the mixture. Season to taste with salt.

Fold one corner towards the opposite corner, creating a triangular pouch. Seal, taking care to push out as much air as possible. Once sealed, bring the two corners of the long end of the triangle together to form a rounded pouch. Transfer the wonton to a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Repeat until all the filling is used, making sure not to let wontons touch.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Bring a large pot of water to boil and add 1/4 of the wontons. Cook until they just begin to float, about 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon or wire mesh spider and transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet. Separate the wontons so they don't touch. Repeat with remaining three batches.                                                                                                                             5                                                                            Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a 12-inch cast iron or non-stick skillet over medium heat over medium heat until shimmering. Add as many wontons as you can fit in a single layer and cook, swirling pan occasionally, until golden brown and crisp on the bottom. Transfer the wontons to a sering plate with the crisp side up.

Add the light corn syrup, and stir gently with a heatproof spatula until everything is mixed well. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring often and making sure to scrape the bottom of the pot to keep the mixture from burning, until the mixture reaches 230F/100C, about 30 minutes.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Add the butter to the caramel mixture, and fish out the vanilla bean with a slotted spoon. Stirring continuously, cook the caramel until it reaches 241°F/116°C, 15 to 20 minutes; it will be a deep tawny color and have slow, rolling bubbles in the center. Remove it from the heat.                                                                                                                            5                                                                            Stir in the salt, bourbon, and the vanilla extract (if using), making sure to mix well so that they're distributed evenly.

Allow to cool for about 5 minutes, stirring it a couple times, until it thickens up a little bit and has the consistency of hot fudge. (Alternately, spoon directly from the pot after letting cool for about 5 minutes.)                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Pour a couple tablespoons' worth of caramel onto each pecan cluster. Allow them to set up until they are no longer warm, about 20 minutes.                                                                                                                             7                                                                            Meanwhile, temper the 2 cups chocolate in a heat-proof bowl over boiling water.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Once the caramel has set up, pour some prepared chocolate into a clean funnel.

What makes this possible is the use of exclusively Dijon clones, exceptionally well suited to Oregon's cool climate and exhibiting a richness that does not depend on oak. INOX screams of the hallmarks of a cool climate-brightness, pinpoint fruit, and explosive aromas and flavors. We intend INOX for a full range of use, from hot weather chilling to elegant dinner complements.Quintessential INOX, with lovely white aromas of gardenia and other flowers, peach, apricot, pear, pineapple, and green apple candy showing on the nose and palate; it shows a great balance with relatively low alcohol for the year and bright acid; the length is lovely and the weight rich, with a supple, silky texture; flavors linger, with cherry and peach accents.

In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, melted butter, milk, half and half, vanilla, and activated yeast mixture.2Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the wet mixture, whisking in the dry mixture from the sides until you get a fairly smooth batter (small lumps are OK).

Once the iron is heated, brush it with vegetable oil, fill it with batter, close the lid, and cook until the waffle is golden brown (when the steam starts to diminish from the iron, you can open the top and peek for doneness). Transfer the waffle to the wire rack on the baking sheet in the oven to keep warm.

Preheat the oven to 400°F (204° C).2. Sift the cornmeal, salt, sugar, baking soda, and baking powder into a large bowl and combine. Make a well in the center and add the beaten eggs into the center but do not incorporate them. Set aside.3. Place the butter in a 1 1/2-quart souffle dish or a 8-inch square baking dish and put it in the oven to heat just until the butter melts. (You don’t want to preheat the dish as long as you would, say, a cast-iron skillet in which you intend to bake corn bread. Such a high heat could cause the spoon bread to separate.)4. Now vigorously stir the eggs into the cornmeal mixture. Then add the buttermilk, stirring well. Set aside.5.

Pour batter into crock pot.Stir the nuts, if using, into the reserved flour mixture. Sprinkle over the top of the cake batter.Place a large paper towel over the top of the crock pot insert, then place the lid on top. Cook on HIGH for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours (mine took 2), or until a toothpick comes out clean around the edges. The center might be a little under done on top (but itll be done underneath).Serve warm straight from the crockpot or store in an airtight container for up to 3 days. For easy serving, use the slow cooker liner. That way you can just pick the whole liner out, peel it off, and serve the cake.To bake in a traditional oven: use a 9x13 pan sprayed with nonstick cooking spray and bake at 350 for approximately 35-45 minutes.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Whisk flour, brown sugar, and salt in a large bowl.
