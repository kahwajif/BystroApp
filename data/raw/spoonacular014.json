Line 2 standard muffin tins with cupcake liners.</p><p>In a small bowl, combine the flours and set aside.</p><p>In a large bowl, on the medium speed of an electric mixer, cream the butter until smooth. Add the sugar gradually and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.</p><p>Mix the milk and vanilla together in a small bowl.</p><p>Add the dry ingredients in 3 parts, alternating with the milk and vanilla mixture. With each addition, beat until the ingredients are incorporated but do not overbeat.</p><p>Carefully spoon the batter into the cupcake liners.  With my small cookie scoop, I used two scoops-worth into each baking cup to fill about 2/3s of the way full. Bake in the middle of the oven until tops turn golden brown and toothpick or cake-tester comes out clean, about 18-20 minutes.</p><p>Cool the cupcakes in tins for about 15 minutes. Remove from the tins and cool completely on a wire rack before icing.</p><p>While the cupcakes are cooling, place all the ganache ingredients in a glass bowl that you can place over a boiling saucepan of water, acting as a double boiler. Stir constantly until all ingredients and melted and incorporated. Dip tops of cupcakes into ganache and set aside to set while preparing buttercream.</p><p>{for buttercream}</p><p>In a food processor, puree fresh strawberries until smooth. Add 2 Tablespoons of sugar, mix together, and set aside.</p><p>Over a pot of simmering water, create a double boiler with the bowl of your stand mixer (or the bowl you will be mixing your buttercream in). Whisk egg whites and sugar into the bowl over simmering water. Continue mixing for about 5 minutes, or until all sugar is dissolved.</p><p>With whisk attachment of your stand mixer on high, whisk until egg whites form stiff peaks and the bowl is completely cooled. This will take quite awhile  about 15 minutes.</p><p>One square at a time, add butter while the mixer is continually mixing. Continue to do this until all butter is mixed in. Add vanilla.

Press the mixture into the pan, make sure you spread it up the sides of the pan. Bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes. Remove and set aside to cool. Brown the ground beef in a dutch oven over medium heat, make sure to break up the pieces so it's a fine texture. Once the pink is gone you can drain off the additional fats if you like. Add the tomatoes, cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, ancho chile, white pepper and salt. Bring this mixture to a boil, reduce the heat and cover, allow to simmer for about 25 minutes or so. Stir in the masa harina and beans, continue to simmer, uncovered this time, for about another 45 to 60 minutes. It's done once it's thick, and the smell is fragrant.

(or non-stick baking spray), so fudge doesn't stick.Place chocolate chips and marshmallow fluff in a large mixing bowl. Set aside.In a bottom-heavy sauce pot, over medium heat, start melting butter and add sweetened condensed milk. Bring to simmer over medium heat, stirring constantly so that condensed milk doesn't burn.Pour hot condensed milk mixture into the bowl and whisk until all smooth. (You will want to start whisking slowly, so the hot mixture doesn't splatter on you, and then increase your whisking speed to get the mixture nice and smooth. If using a metal mixing bowl, you may want to hold it with an oven mitt while whisking. If whisking starts to get a little tough, switch to a rubber spatula.)Quickly fold in peppermint crunch baking chips, pour your fudge mixture into the prepared baking dish and spread it evenly. Let it stand on the counter until it cools to room temperature. Then, place the pan in the refrigerator to chill and firm up for a couple of hours. (If you want to chill it overnight, you will need to cover it in saran wrap so it doesn't start to dry.)Once cooled, take the fudge with parchment paper out of the pan. Using a cookie scoop, scoop out chocolate fudge and shape them into even fudge balls. Place them on a large cutting board covered with parchment paper. (You may have to use two boards.) Place them into a freezer for 15-20 minutes.Unwrap candy canes and place then into a ziplock bag. Crush candy canes with a flat side of the meat tenderizer. Place crushed candy canes in a bowl on your work station.Melt the chocolate melts according to the package instructions. (I definitely recommend using a double boiler.)Using a fork, dip each fudge ball into chocolate, covering it completely. Gently shake off excess chocolate by moving the fork up or down and gently tapping the fork on the side of the double boiler.Quickly sprinkle it generously with crushed candy canes and lay it back on the parchment paper (you'll need a toothpick or something small to help you slide the truffle off the fork).

sit at room temperature for 20 minutes prior to marinating and cooking. Tenderize the meat by placing on a cutting board, covering its top with a sheet of plastic wrap, and hammer (side with spikes) on both sides. Whisk together the soy sauce, olive oil, and black pepper in a small bowl. Pour marinade into a long rectangular pyrex and lay both steaks in the marinade. Marinate the steaks for 5 to 7 minutes in one side and then flip steaks to marinate for additional 5 to 7 minutes on the other side. Remove meat from marinade and shake to remove excess marinade. NOTE: In Southern Brazil, traditionally only coarse salt is applied to the meat right before grilling on a long metal skewer over flames. The marinade with soy sauce is my own way of re-creating this family fave!Heat a large cast-iron griddle (flat side of the griddle without the grill marks) over high heat on a large burner.When griddle is sizzling hot (sprinkle a bit of water to test and let evaporate), add the steaks. Let meat get a good sear for about 2 minutes on each of both sides. Place seared steaks in double thickness of aluminum foil and wrap well to avoid heat escaping from the wrap. Place wraps onto a baking sheet, cover with an inverted pyrex, and allow to sit for 15 minutes at room temperature. Remove meat from foil, sprinkle lime juice on top, let sit for about 5 minutes, and slice thinly against the grain of the meat (or chop into fine, small slivers). Since Brazilians use cutlery to eat pizza and flatbreads, I arranged sliced steak on top of mine. If you eat pizzas and flatbreads with bare hands (American way), chop steak finely to top flatbread. This flatbread can also be simply folded like a taco!While meat is wrapped in foil, preheat oven to 400 degrees F, prepare the chimichurri sauce, and assemble the flatbread.To prepare the chimichurri sauce (a type of South American pesto): In a food processor, combine the garlic, vinegar, parsley, oregano, lime juice, and olive oil. Process enough for all ingredients to blend in together well while yet obtaining a chunky sauce. Transfer to a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Mix well and set aside.To assemble the flatbreads: Place the naan breads on a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush each bread with ¼ teaspoon of olive oil and then, spread 1 teaspoon of tomato sauce over each bread. Sprinkle evenly about ½ cup of cheese on top of each bread.If you prefer to keep steak rare to medium-rare, bake flatbreads for about 8 minutes, remove from oven, and only then arrange sliced or finely chopped steak on top. Pour about 2 tablespoons of chimichurri sauce per flatbread on top of the steak, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, and serve immediately.However, if you do prefer steak well-done, arrange either sliced or finely chopped steak on top of the flatbread, pour 2 tablespoons of the chimichurri sauce per flatbread on top of the steak, and bake for about 4 to 5 minutes or just enough for the cheese to melt. Remove from oven and serve while still hot with the remaining chimichurri sauce and Parmesan cheese. Flatbread can be accompanied by a glass of red wine.

While hot, carefully roll up cake and towel from narrow end. Cool completely on cooling rack, about 1hourWhile cake is cooling make simple syrup with equal amount of sugar and water and set aside.Place your mixing bowl and wire whisk in the freezer for about 15-30 minutes. Place the vanilla extract, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and cocoa powder in the cold bowl. Stir in about 2 tablespoons of the cream to form a thick paste (this will dissolve the cocoa powder). Then add the rest of the cream and beat just until stiff peaks form. If not using immediately, cover and refrigerate.

If cutting the butter into small pieces: Add the butter pieces and work it into the flour until you have a pebbly mixture. The butter pieces should look cobbly and be different sizes. If working with a whole stick of frozen butter (my preference): With a grater, grate the butter directly into the mixing bowl.

One reason for this lofty reputation is Rosella's Vineyard. Gary Franscioni planted his home ranch, named for his lovely wife, in the heart of the Highlands. Gary's home vineyard is planted with a selection of the best available Pinot Noir clones and farmed with unparalleled passion and attention to detail. We at Bernardus are fortunate to have access to three small blocks: 2 planted with clone 777, and the third with the celebrated Pisoni clone.Each block is individually monitored for ripeness in order to hand-pick each clone at its perfect ripeness level. The grapes are sorted at the winery and fermented in small individual fermenters using specially selected yeasts. Once fermentation and pressing are complete, each lot is aged separately for 10 months in the finest French oak barrels. Each barrel is evaluated individually and the final selection is made through a lengthy series of tasting trials.The robe of our 2011 Rosella's is a deep crimson. On the nose we find aromas of candied red cherry fruits along with notes of oak and spice. The palate is very full and complex, exuding flavors of red cherry and berries, accented by notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a beautifully intense wine that will age wonderfully for many years to come.","price":"$47.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/465202-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9400000000000001,"ratingCount":6,"score":0.8873684210526316,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fbernardus-rosellas-vineyard-pinot-noir-2011%2F131978"}]},"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.In a large skillet heat the 2 Tablespoons olive oil over medium high heat.
