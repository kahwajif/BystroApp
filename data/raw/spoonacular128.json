For the macarons, prepare two baking sheets with parchment and set aside. Heat oven to 330F.2. Place egg whites and sugar in a stand mixer bowl, fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat on medium low speed until egg whites start to form loose translucent bubbles. Increase mixer speed to medium and beat until meringue turns foamy and white, about 2 minutes. Increase mixer to high and beat until meringue holds glossy stiff peaks, about another 2-3 minutes. (We found it worked better when it was between soft peaks and stiff peaks.)3. Sift powdered sugar, almond meal, and cocoa powder.4. Add dry ingredients in increments to meringue. Fold dry ingredients into meringue until thoroughly combined. The batter should hold its shape when spooned on itself and start to slowly flatten out after about 15-20 seconds. Transfer batter to pastry bag and let rest for 20 minutes before piping. (Our first batch we piped without resting. It’s fine to not wait, but we did find that letting it rest for a bit helped the macarons keep its shape.)5. Pipe circles of batter onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Take hold of each pan and give it quick hard tap against the counter, turn the pan 90 degrees and give it another quick hard tap. This will deflate any bubbles and help prevent cracked shells. Don’t tap them too hard or the batter will spread.6. Bake for about 15-17 minutes in the center of the oven. If both baking sheets won’t fit in your oven side by side, bake one at at time. We found that the macarons baked on the bottom rack would crack compared to those baked on the center rack. Remove from oven and transfer to a cooling rack. Leave shells to cool completely on pan. Shells will cleanly peel away from parchment when ready.7. For the buttercream, beat the butter, vanilla, salt, and caramel topping in a mixer until blended and fluffy. Gradually add the powdered sugar and mix until smooth. If too thick to pipe, add a splash of milk until the proper consistency is reached. Pipe buttercream on the bottom side of a macaron and top with another macaron.

Add the pork tenderloin to the marinade.\nCover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour, or up to overnight.\nRemove the pork tenderloin from the refrigerator an hour before you intend to cook it.\n\nToast the panko breadcrumbs: Heat a thick-bottomed sauté pan on medium high heat. Add the panko breadcrumbs to the pan. Lower the heat to medium and slowly toast the panko breadcrumbs until golden brown.\nRemove from heat. Stir the olive oil, salt, and pepper into the panko breadcrumbs until they are well coated.\n\nDredge tenderloin in toasted panko: Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil and place a baking rack or roasting rack over it. Place the toasted panko in a shallow bowl for dredging. Remove the pork tenderloin from the buttermilk marinade and place it in the bowl of breadcrumbs. Dredge the tenderloin in the breadcrumbs, pressing the tenderloin firmly into the crumbs as you roll it to help the crumbs adhere.\n\nBake: Place the breaded tenderloin on the baking rack and bake at 375°F for 30 to 40 minutes, until the internal temperature is 145°F. (Please note that the USDA now recommends that pork be cooked to 145°F, meaning the cooked pork will be a little pink, and that's perfectly okay.)\nRemove the pork from the oven when done and let rest on the rack for 10 to 15 minutes while you make the sauce.\n\nMake sauce: To make the sauce, melt a tablespoon of butter in a shallow saucepan. Add the minced shallots and cook on medium heat until softened, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook a minute more.\nAdd one cup of cream, the mustard, salt, and pepper to the shallots. Stir to combine and let come to a simmer.\nSimmer gently until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in 1 Tbsp of chopped parsley. Set aside until ready to serve. (If you need to reheat the sauce to serve and it has thickened up, loosen it with a little water while you reheat.)\n\nSlice tenderloin and serve with sauce: Gently transfer the pork tenderloin to a cutting board and slice into 1/2-inch thick medallions. Place sauce on a serving platter and place the pork medallions on top of the sauce. Sprinkle everything with chopped parsley.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Marinate pork tenderloin","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Combine the marinade ingredients (buttermilk, Dijon mustard, brown sugar, salt) in a medium bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":1002046,"name":"dijon mustard","image":"dijon-mustard.jpg"},{"id":19334,"name":"brown sugar","image":"dark-brown-sugar.png"},{"id":1230,"name":"buttermilk","image":"buttermilk.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the pork tenderloin to the marinade.","ingredients":[{"id":10218,"name":"pork tenderloin","image":"pork-tenderloin-raw.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour, or up to overnight.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404730,"name":"plastic wrap","image":"plastic-wrap.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Remove the pork tenderloin from the refrigerator an hour before you intend to cook it.","ingredients":[{"id":10218,"name":"pork tenderloin","image":"pork-tenderloin-raw.png"}],"equipment":[]}]},{"name":"Toast the panko breadcrumbs","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat a thick-bottomed sauté pan on medium high heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the panko breadcrumbs to the pan.

Lay chicken flat, skin side down, on cutting board. Shape 12 ounces of sausage into a log roughly 2 inches in diameter and place in the center of the chicken. Lift one side of chicken and wrap tightly around sausage. Lift the other side, allowing the skin from both sides to overlap and form a seal. The chicken should now be wrapped around the sausage. Wrap tightly in several layers of plastic wrap so that chicken forms a  tight cylinder (see note above). Alternatively, chicken can be tightly trussed with butcher's twine.                                                                                                                            2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Place chicken inside a vacuum sealer bag and seal. Place in a large stockpot and cover with warm water. Place over medium-high heat and heat until bubbles just begin to rise from the bottom. Reduce heat to lowest setting and cook until chicken feels firm to the touch and an instant read thermometer inserted through the plastic into the center of the chicken registers 140 to 145°F, about 45 minutes.                                                                                                                            3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 While chicken is cooking, season the duck on all sides with salt and pepper. Place a 36- by 12-inch piece of plastic wrap on the cutting board. Lay duck flat, skin side down, on plastic wrap. Spread remaining sausage evenly over surface of meat. When chicken is cooked, remove from bag and plastic wrap and carefully pat dry with paper towels. Place hot chicken directly on top of duck, aligned along the center. Using the plastic wrap to aid you, carefully shape the duck around the chicken. Roll into a tight cylinder in several layers of plastic wrap.

Place in a large stockpot and cover with warm water. Place over medium-high heat and heat until bubbles just begin to rise from the bottom. Reduce heat to lowest setting and cook until Duck feels firm to the touch, about 30 minutes.                                                                                                                            5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Remove duck from water. If you used a vacuum bag or plastic wrap, remove both, then tightly truss the duck with twine. Dry exterior thoroughly with paper towels.                                                                                                                            6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add duck/chicken and cook, turning occasionally, until well browned and crisp on all sides, pouring off excess rendered fat as necessary (you can reserve this fat for another use), about 15 minutes total.                                                                                                                            7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Adjust oven rack to lowest position and preheat oven to 425°F. Place turkey skin-side-down on a cutting board and season exposed surface with salt and pepper. Remove twine from duck/chicken and place in the center of the turkey, aligned along the center. If necessary, trim duck/chicken roll so that is is the same length as the turkey breasts.

Sleepy Hollow consistently produces Chardonnay with intense tropical fruit character, which exhibits both richness and finesse. Sleepy Hollow Chardonnay is considered by many as one of the quality standards for California Chardonnay. Vineyard Manager and Winemaker Sam Balderas keeps yields low to increase concentration and minimizes the handling of the wine to preserve the fruit's natural essence. This wine is 100% barrel fermented in French Oak and aged on the yeast lees to impart a rich, toasty, complex character to the wine. \n\nTasting Notes for this Vintage\nConcentrated rich flavors of tropical fruit marry with mineral elements and French oak accents. A typically high level of acid produces a long, clean finish. Our signature Chardonnay, this wine can be cellared up to nine years and improves with age.

Here’s a quick version. Add 1 Tbsp. salt in 2 cups water. Place a sieve in the bowl so that any sand and grit the clam purge would stay on the bottom of the bowl instead of being consumed by the clams again.Place the clams inside the sieve without overlapping each other. The water level should be right around the clam’s mouth. If there isn’t enough salt water, make more using the same ratio of water and salt. Cover with aluminum foil (to make it dark) and leave it in a cool place for 2 hours. This should give clams enough time to purge sand and grit.Wash the clams carefully with a brush. Clams are now ready to use.Gently clean the dashi kombu with a damp cloth (DO NOT WASH) but leave the white powdery substances which contribute to the umami flavor in the stock.Put clams, water, and dashi kombu in a pot and bring it to a boil over high heat.When boiling, reduce heat to low.Skim off scum and here’s how I do it.

Remove the dashi kombu.Add miso 1 Tbsp. at a time.

Whip the egg white in a clean bowl until stiff peaks form. Whisk in the sugar a tbsp at a time and keep whisking for a couple of mins until the mixture is thick and resembles shaving foam. Gently spoon the mixture into a large freezer bag, then cut a 1.5cm hole in one of the corners. Cover a baking sheet with some baking parchment. Carefully squeeze a small circle of whipped egg white out of the bag, pulling upwards as you do to make a ghost shape. Repeat until the mixture is used up  you should get about 15 ghosts. Bake for 1 hrs until crisp. Can be stored in an airtight container for up to 2 days.\nNow make the cake. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Tip the cocoa powder, self-raising flour and sugar into a large bowl, breaking up any clumps of sugar. Mix together the eggs, milk and oil in a measuring cup or bowl, then pour over the dry ingredients and stir everything together until smooth. Grease and line a deep baking dish (20 x 30 x 5cm) with baking parchment. Pour in the cake mixture and bake for 30 mins. Leave to cool, then turn out onto a serving plate. Alternatively, wrap well and store for up to 2 days.\nFinish decorating the cake: heat cream in a saucepan until just boiling. Place the dark chocolate in a large bowl and pour over the hot cream. Stir until the chocolate melts. Use a clean brush to paint a layer of chocolate over 7 rich tea finger biscuits, then set aside to cool. Pour the rest of the chocolate mixture over the cake and smooth over with a knife. Whizz the chocolate cookies, or bash in a freezer bag with a rolling pin, until small crumbs form. Sprinkle over the top of the cake.\nPlace the white chocolate in a small bowl, set over a pan of simmering water. Leave for 5 mins or until melted, then spoon into a small freezer bag. Wait for 10 mins so the mixture is not too runny, then cut a tiny hole in one corner of the bag. Pipe out 2 small blobs onto each ghost, place a silver ball on each to make eyes, then pipe out suitable words and shapes on the gravestones. Leave for 30 mins to set, then push the biscuit gravestones into the cake and arrange the ghosts around. To get the ghosts to fly, push a thin wire (you can get these from a florist shop  remember to remove before eating) into the bottom of the ghost, then place in the cake, hiding the wire behind a gravestone.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the ghosts, heat oven to 110C/90C fan/gas .

Melt 2 Tbsp butter in the pan, add the cubed bread, and stir to coat the bread pieces with the melted butter. Let bread cubes toast; only turn them when they have become a little browned on a side.\n\nBrown the sausage: Heat a large (4 to 6-qt) pan on medium heat. Breaking of inch-sized chunks, add the Italian sausage to the pan, taking care not to crowd the bottom of the pan.\nDo not stir, just let cook until lightly browned on one side, then flip the sausage over and brown on the other side. When lightly browned, use a slotted spoon to remove, set aside.\n\nCook the onions and apples: You should have at least a tablespoon of fat in the pan, if not, add some butter. Heat the pan to medium high. Add the onions and celery and cook until onions are translucent, 3-5 minutes.\nAdd the chopped apples and cook for a few minutes more.\n\nCombine the stuffing: Add back in the browned sausage, the butter toasted bread cubes, parsley, thyme, and sage. Gently mix. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat.\n\nPrepare roasting pan and stuff the roast: Preheat oven to 350°F. Place the crown roast in a shallow roasting pan. Fill the center of the crown loosely with stuffing (do not pack in the stuffing).\nWhatever extra stuffing you have, place in a separate, buttered, oven proof pan.\nCover the tips of the ribs with aluminum foil to prevent scorching of the bones.\nAdd one cup water to the pan.\n\nRoast the pork: Roast the pork at 350°F on middle rack of oven. Cover the stuffing with foil after about 30 minutes.\nCook until a meat thermometer inserted deep into center of meat (do not touch bones, which are on the outside of the roast) registers 145°F, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours total.\n\nBake extra stuffing: Add 1/2 cup of water to the remaining stuffing, and bake it (next to or under roast, starting 30 minutes before roast is done, or while the roast is resting), covered with foil, 30 minutes.\n\nLet the pork rest: Transfer pork to a platter and let stand 20 minutes.\n\nCarve: To carve the pork, steady the roast with a fork, with a large sharp knife, cut down through each rib to detach the pork chops.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Season the pork roast: ","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Mix together the roast seasonings of thyme, sage, salt and pepper.

Sleepy Hollow consistently produces Chardonnay with intense tropical fruit character, which exhibits both richness and finesse. Sleepy Hollow Chardonnay is considered by many as one of the quality standards for California Chardonnay. Vineyard Manager and Winemaker Sam Balderas keeps yields low to increase concentration and minimizes the handling of the wine to preserve the fruit's natural essence. This wine is 100% barrel fermented in French Oak and aged on the yeast lees to impart a rich, toasty, complex character to the wine. \n\nTasting Notes for this Vintage\nConcentrated rich flavors of tropical fruit marry with mineral elements and French oak accents. A typically high level of acid produces a long, clean finish. Our signature Chardonnay, this wine can be cellared up to nine years and improves with age.
